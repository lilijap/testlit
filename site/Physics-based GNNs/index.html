        <tr id="Simulating rigid collisions among arbitrary shapes is notoriously difficult due to complex geometry and the strong non-linearity of the interactions. While graph neural network (GNN)-based models are effective at learning to simulate complex physical dynamics, such as fluids, cloth and articulated bodies, they have been less effective and efficient on rigid-body physics, except with very simple shapes. Existing methods that model collisions through the meshes' nodes are often inaccurate because they struggle when collisions occur on faces far from nodes. Alternative approaches that represent the geometry densely with many particles are prohibitively expensive for complex shapes. Here we introduce the Face Interaction Graph Network (FIGNet) which extends beyond GNN-based methods, and computes interactions between mesh faces, rather than nodes. Compared to learned node- and particle-based methods, FIGNet is around 4x more accurate in simulating complex shape interactions, while also 8x more computationally efficient on sparse, rigid meshes. Moreover, FIGNet can learn frictional dynamics directly from real-world data, and can be more accurate than analytical solvers given modest amounts of training data. FIGNet represents a key step forward in one of the few remaining physical domains which have seen little competition from learned simulators, and offers allied fields such as robotics, graphics and mechanical design a new tool for simulation and model-based planning.">

        <tr id=": Recent years have seen a rise in techniques for modeling discontinuous dynamics, such as rigid contact or switching motion modes, using deep learning. A common claim is that deep networks are incapable of accurately modeling rigid-body dynamics without explicit modules for handling contacts, due to the continuous nature of how deep networks are parameterized. Here we investigate this claim with experiments on established real and simulated datasets and show that general-purpose graph network simulators, with no contact-speciﬁc assumptions, can learn and predict contact discontinuities. Furthermore, contact dynamics learned by graph network simulators capture real-world cube tossing trajectories more accurately than highly engineered robotics simulators, even when provided with only 8 – 16 trajectories. Overall, this suggests that rigid-body dynamics do not pose a fundamental challenge for deep networks with the appropriate general architecture and parameterization. Instead, our work opens new directions for considering when deep learning-based models might be preferable to traditional simulation environments for accurately modeling real-world contact dynamics.">

        <tr id="Mesh-based simulations are central to modeling complex physical systems in many disciplines across science and engineering. Mesh representations support powerful numerical integration methods and their resolution can be adapted to strike favorable trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. However, high-dimensional scientific simulations are very expensive to run, and solvers and parameters must often be tuned individually to each system studied. Here we introduce MeshGraphNets, a framework for learning mesh-based simulations using graph neural networks. Our model can be trained to pass messages on a mesh graph and to adapt the mesh discretization during forward simulation. Our results show it can accurately predict the dynamics of a wide range of physical systems, including aerodynamics, structural mechanics, and cloth. The model's adaptivity supports learning resolution-independent dynamics and can scale to more complex state spaces at test time. Our method is also highly efficient, running 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than the simulation on which it is trained. Our approach broadens the range of problems on which neural network simulators can operate and promises to improve the efficiency of complex, scientific modeling tasks.">

        <tr id="Designing physical artifacts that serve a purpose - such as tools and other functional structures - is central to engineering as well as everyday human behavior. Though automating design has tremendous promise, general-purpose methods do not yet exist. Here we explore a simple, fast, and robust approach to inverse design which combines learned forward simulators based on graph neural networks with gradient-based design optimization. Our approach solves high-dimensional problems with complex physical dynamics, including designing surfaces and tools to manipulate fluid flows and optimizing the shape of an airfoil to minimize drag. This framework produces high-quality designs by propagating gradients through trajectories of hundreds of steps, even when using models that were pre-trained for single-step predictions on data substantially different from the design tasks. In our fluid manipulation tasks, the resulting designs outperformed those found by sampling-based optimization techniques. In airfoil design, they matched the quality of those obtained with a specialized solver. Our results suggest that despite some remaining challenges, machine learning-based simulators are maturing to the point where they can support general-purpose design optimization across a variety of domains.">

        <tr id="In the area of physical simulations, nearly all neural-network-based methods directly predict future states from the input states. However, many traditional simulation engines instead model the constraints of the system and select the state which satisfies them. Here we present a framework for constraint-based learned simulation, where a scalar constraint function is implemented as a graph neural network, and future predictions are computed by solving the optimization problem defined by the learned constraint. Our model achieves comparable or better accuracy to top learned simulators on a variety of challenging physical domains, and offers several unique advantages. We can improve the simulation accuracy on a larger system by applying more solver iterations at test time. We also can incorporate novel hand-designed constraints at test time and simulate new dynamics which were not present in the training data. Our constraint-based framework shows how key techniques from traditional simulation and numerical methods can be leveraged as inductive biases in machine learning simulators.">

        <tr id="Realistic simulation is critical for applications ranging from robotics to animation. Traditional analytic simulators sometimes struggle to capture sufficiently realistic simulation which can lead to problems including the well known"sim-to-real"gap in robotics. Learned simulators have emerged as an alternative for better capturing real-world physical dynamics, but require access to privileged ground truth physics information such as precise object geometry or particle tracks. Here we propose a method for learning simulators directly from observations. Visual Particle Dynamics (VPD) jointly learns a latent particle-based representation of 3D scenes, a neural simulator of the latent particle dynamics, and a renderer that can produce images of the scene from arbitrary views. VPD learns end to end from posed RGB-D videos and does not require access to privileged information. Unlike existing 2D video prediction models, we show that VPD's 3D structure enables scene editing and long-term predictions. These results pave the way for downstream applications ranging from video editing to robotic planning.">

Our model takes graphs as input, performs object- and relation-centric reasoning in a way that is analogous to a simulation, and is implemented using deep neural networks. We evaluate its ability to reason about several challenging physical domains: n-body problems, rigid-body collision, and non-rigid dynamics. Our results show it can be trained to accurately simulate the physical trajectories of dozens of objects over thousands of time steps, estimate abstract quantities such as energy, and generalize automatically to systems with different numbers and configurations of objects and relations. Our interaction network implementation is the first general-purpose, learnable physics engine, and a powerful general framework for reasoning about object and relations in a wide variety of complex real-world domains.">

Here we introduce a new class of learnable models--based on graph networks--which implement an inductive bias for object- and relation-centric representations of complex, dynamical systems. Our results show that as a forward model, our approach supports accurate predictions from real and simulated data, and surprisingly strong and efficient generalization, across eight distinct physical systems which we varied parametrically and structurally. We also found that our inference model can perform system identification. Our models are also differentiable, and support online planning via gradient-based trajectory optimization, as well as offline policy optimization. Our framework offers new opportunities for harnessing and exploiting rich knowledge about the world, and takes a key step toward building machines with more human-like representations of the world.">

        <tr id="Artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone a renaissance recently, making major progress in key domains such as vision, language, control, and decision-making. This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute resources, which have fit the natural strengths of deep learning. However, many defining characteristics of human intelligence, which developed under much different pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches. In particular, generalizing beyond one's experiences--a hallmark of human intelligence from infancy--remains a formidable challenge for modern AI. 
The following is part position paper, part review, and part unification. We argue that combinatorial generalization must be a top priority for AI to achieve human-like abilities, and that structured representations and computations are key to realizing this objective. Just as biology uses nature and nurture cooperatively, we reject the false choice between "hand-engineering" and "end-to-end" learning, and instead advocate for an approach which benefits from their complementary strengths. We explore how using relational inductive biases within deep learning architectures can facilitate learning about entities, relations, and rules for composing them. We present a new building block for the AI toolkit with a strong relational inductive bias--the graph network--which generalizes and extends various approaches for neural networks that operate on graphs, and provides a straightforward interface for manipulating structured knowledge and producing structured behaviors. We discuss how graph networks can support relational reasoning and combinatorial generalization, laying the foundation for more sophisticated, interpretable, and flexible patterns of reasoning. As a companion to this paper, we have released an open-source software library for building graph networks, with demonstrations of how to use them in practice.">

Our results show that our model can generalize from single-timestep predictions with thousands of particles during training, to different initial conditions, thousands of timesteps, and at least an order of magnitude more particles at test time. Our model was robust to hyperparameter choices across various evaluation metrics: the main determinants of long-term performance were the number of message-passing steps, and mitigating the accumulation of error by corrupting the training data with noise. Our GNS framework advances the state-of-the-art in learned physical simulation, and holds promise for solving a wide range of complex forward and inverse problems.">

The technique works as follows: we first encourage sparse latent representations when we train a GNN in a supervised setting, then we apply symbolic regression to components of the learned model to extract explicit physical relations. We find the correct known equations, including force laws and Hamiltonians, can be extracted from the neural network. We then apply our method to a non-trivial cosmology example-a detailed dark matter simulation-and discover a new analytic formula which can predict the concentration of dark matter from the mass distribution of nearby cosmic structures. The symbolic expressions extracted from the GNN using our technique also generalized to out-of-distribution data better than the GNN itself. Our approach offers alternative directions for interpreting neural networks and discovering novel physical principles from the representations they learn.">

We then use symbolic regression to correctly infer an analytical expression for the force law implicitly learned by the neural network, which our results showed is equivalent to Newton’s law of gravitation. The key assumptions our method makes are translational and rotational equivariance, and Newton’s second and third laws of motion. It did not, however, require any assumptions about the masses of planets and moons or physical constants, but nonetheless, they, too, were accurately inferred with our method. Naturally, the classical law of gravitation has been known since Isaac Newton, but our results demonstrate that our method can discover unknown laws and hidden properties from observed data.">

        <tr id="We introduce latent intuitive physics, a transfer learning framework for physics simulation that can infer hidden properties of fluids from a single 3D video and simulate the observed fluid in novel scenes. Our key insight is to use latent features drawn from a learnable prior distribution conditioned on the underlying particle states to capture the invisible and complex physical properties. To achieve this, we train a parametrized prior learner given visual observations to approximate the visual posterior of inverse graphics, and both the particle states and the visual posterior are obtained from a learned neural renderer. The converged prior learner is embedded in our probabilistic physics engine, allowing us to perform novel simulations on unseen geometries, boundaries, and dynamics without knowledge of the true physical parameters. We validate our model in three ways: (i) novel scene simulation with the learned visual-world physics, (ii) future prediction of the observed fluid dynamics, and (iii) supervised particle simulation. Our model demonstrates strong performance in all three tasks.">

        <tr id="We present a neural operator architecture to simulate Lagrangian dynamics, such as fluid flow, granular flows, and elastoplasticity. Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method (FEM), suffer from long run times and large memory consumption. On the other hand, approaches based on graph neural networks are faster but still suffer from long computation times on dense graphs, which are often required for high-fidelity simulations. Our model, GIOROM or Graph Interaction Operator for Reduced-Order Modeling, learns temporal dynamics within a reduced-order setting, capturing spatial features from a highly sparse graph representation of the input and generalizing to arbitrary spatial locations during inference. The model is geometry-aware and discretization-agnostic and can generalize to different initial conditions, velocities, and geometries after training. We show that point clouds of the order of 100,000 points can be inferred from sparse graphs with $\sim$1000 points, with negligible change in computation time. We empirically evaluate our model on elastic solids, Newtonian fluids, Non-Newtonian fluids, Drucker-Prager granular flows, and von Mises elastoplasticity. On these benchmarks, our approach results in a 25$\times$ speedup compared to other neural network-based physics simulators while delivering high-fidelity predictions of complex physical systems and showing better performance on most benchmarks.

Yet, constructing accurate predictive models for a variety of deformable objects, especially those with unknown physical properties, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces AdaptiGraph, a learning-based dynamics modeling approach that enables robots to predict, adapt to, and control a wide array of challenging deformable materials with unknown physical properties. AdaptiGraph leverages the highly flexible graph-based neural dynamics (GBND) framework, which represents material bits as particles and employs a graph neural network (GNN) to predict particle motion. Its key innovation is a unified physical property-conditioned GBND model capable of predicting the motions of diverse materials with varying physical properties without retraining. Upon encountering new materials during online deployment, AdaptiGraph utilizes a physical property optimization process for a few-shot adaptation of the model, enhancing its fit to the observed interaction data. The adapted models can precisely simulate the dynamics and predict the motion of various deformable materials, such as ropes, granular media, rigid boxes, and cloth, while adapting to different physical properties, including stiffness, granular size, and center of pressure. On prediction and manipulation tasks involving a diverse set of real-world deformable objects, our method exhibits superior prediction accuracy and task proficiency over non-material-conditioned and non-adaptive models.

We present a framework combining a 3D physics simulator implemented in C++ with a deep learning model constructed using PyTorch. The simulator generates training data encompassing linear and angular motion, elastic collisions, fluid friction, gravitational effects, and damping. Our deep residual network, consisting of an input layer, multiple residual blocks, and an output layer, is designed to handle the complexities of 3D dynamics. We evaluate the network's performance using a datasetof 10,000 simulated scenarios, each involving 3-5 interacting rigid bodies.

        <tr id="Recent work has shown that object-centric representations can greatly help improve the accuracy of learning dynamics while also bringing interpretability. In this work, we take this idea one step further, ask the following question:"can learning disentangled representation further improve the accuracy of visual dynamics prediction in object-centric models?"While there has been some attempt to learn such disentangled representations for the case of static images \citep{nsb}, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work which tries to do this in a general setting for video, without making any specific assumptions about the kind of attributes that an object might have. The key building block of our architecture is the notion of a {\em block}, where several blocks together constitute an object. Each block is represented as a linear combination of a given number of learnable concept vectors, which is iteratively refined during the learning process. The blocks in our model are discovered in an unsupervised manner, by attending over object masks, in a style similar to discovery of slots \citep{slot_attention}, for learning a dense object-centric representation. We employ self-attention via transformers over the discovered blocks to predict the next state resulting in discovery of visual dynamics. We perform a series of experiments on several benchmark 2-D, and 3-D datasets demonstrating that our architecture (1) can discover semantically meaningful blocks (2) help improve accuracy of dynamics prediction compared to SOTA object-centric models (3) perform significantly better in OOD setting where the specific attribute combinations are not seen earlier during training. Our experiments highlight the importance discovery of disentangled representation for visual dynamics prediction.">

Our approach does not assume access to any rigging or intermediate shape keyframes, produces geometrically and temporally consistent motions, and can be used to transfer long motion sequences. Central to our approach are two coupled neural networks that individually predict local geometric and temporal changes that are subsequently integrated, spatially and temporally, to produce the final animated meshes. The two networks are jointly trained, complement each other in producing spatial and temporal signals, and are supervised directly with 3D positional information. During inference, in the absence of keyframes, our method essentially solves a motion extrapolation problem. We test our setup on diverse meshes (synthetic and scanned shapes) to demonstrate its superiority in generating realistic and natural-looking animations on unseen body shapes against SoTA alternatives.

We propose a novel dual Gaussian-Particle representation that models the physical world while (i) enabling predictive simulation of future states and (ii) allowing online correction from visual observations in a dynamic world. Our representation comprises particles that capture the geometrical aspect of objects in the world and can be used alongside a particle-based physics system to anticipate physically plausible future states. Attached to these particles are 3D Gaussians that render images from any viewpoint through a splatting process thus capturing the visual state. By comparing the predicted and observed images, our approach generates visual forces that correct the particle positions while respecting known physical constraints. By integrating predictive physical modelling with continuous visually-derived corrections, our unified representation reasons about the present and future while synchronizing with reality. Our system runs in realtime at 30Hz using only 3 cameras. We validate our approach on 2D and 3D tracking tasks as well as photometric reconstruction quality.

Yet, data-driven DLO dynamics models require large training data sets while their predictions often do not generalize, whereas physics-based models rely on good approximations of physical phenomena and often lack accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-informed neural ODE capable of predicting agile movements with significantly less data and hyper-parameter tuning. In particular, we model DLOs as serial chains of rigid bodies interconnected by passive elastic joints in which interaction forces are predicted by neural networks. The proposed model accurately predicts the motion of an robotically-actuated aluminium rod and an elastic foam cylinder after being trained on only thirty seconds of data.

These images are fed into a controller that maps the visual targets into a sequence of joint-positions. We study GENIMA on 25 RLBench and 9 real-world manipulation tasks. We find that, by lifting actions into image-space, internet pre-trained diffusion models can generate policies that outperform state-of-the-art visuomotor approaches, especially in robustness to scene perturbations and generalizing to novel objects.

We experimentally validate our method on a goal-conditioned manipulation task in five diverse scenarios. Our method significantly improves this goal-conditioned task, achieving an average error of 13.2mm in complex scenarios.

Numerical differentiation (ND) using the finite difference (FD) method is efficient in physics-constrained designs, even in parameterized settings, often employing body-fitted block-structured grids for complex flow cases. However, convolution operators in CNNs for finite differences are typically limited to single-block grids. To address this, we use graphs and graph networks (GNs) to learn flow representations across multi-block structured grids. We propose a graph convolution-based finite difference method (GC-FDM) to train GNs in a physics-constrained manner, enabling differentiable finite difference operations on graph unstructured outputs. Our goal is to solve parametric steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for flows around a backward-facing step, a circular cylinder, and double cylinders, using multi-block structured grids. Comparing our method to a CFD solver under various boundary conditions, we demonstrate improved training efficiency and accuracy, achieving a minimum relative error of $10^{-3}$ in velocity field prediction and a 20\% reduction in training cost compared to PINNs.">

        <tr id="SE(3) equivariance is a fundamental property that is highly desirable to maintain in physical dynamics modeling. This property ensures neural outputs to remain robust when the inputs are translated or rotated. Recently, there have been several proposals for SE(3) equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) that have shown promising results in simulating particle dynamics. However, existing works have neglected an important issue that current SE(3) equivariant GNNs cannot scale to large particle systems. Although some simple normalization techniques are already in use to stabilize the training dynamics of equivariant graph networks, they actually break the SE(3) equivariance of the architectures. In this work, we first show the numerical instability of training equivariant GNNs on large particle systems and then analyze some existing normalization strategies adopted in modern works. We propose a new normalization layer called GeoNorm, which can satisfy the SE(3) equivariance and simultaneously stabilize the training process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on N-body system simulation tasks with larger particle system sizes. The experimental results demonstrate that GeoNorm successfully preserves the SE(3) equivariance compared to baseline techniques and stabilizes the training dynamics of SE(3) equivariant GNNs on large systems.">

Our model is trained in two stages: First we train our autoregressive generative model using only annotated cuboidal parts as supervision and next, we train our blending network using explicit 3D supervision, in the form of watertight meshes. Evaluations on various ShapeNet objects showcase the ability of our model to perform shape generation from diverse inputs \eg from scratch, from a partial object, from text and images, as well size-guided generation, by explicitly conditioning on a bounding box that defines the object's boundaries. Moreover, as our model considers the underlying part-based structure of a 3D object, we are able to select a specific part and produce shapes with meaningful variations of this part. As evidenced by our experiments, our model generates 3D shapes that are both more realistic and diverse than existing part-based and non part-based methods, while at the same time is simpler to implement and train.">

Previous approaches to learning vector fields on surfaces treat vectors as multi-dimensional scalar fields, using traditional scalar-valued architectures to process channels individually, thus fail to preserve fundamental intrinsic properties of the vector field. The core idea of this work is to introduce a trainable vector heat diffusion module to spatially propagate vector-valued feature data across the surface, which we incorporate into our proposed architecture that consists of vector-valued neurons. Our architecture is invariant to rigid motion of the input, isometric deformation, and choice of local tangent bases, and is robust to discretizations of the surface. We evaluate our Vector Heat Network on triangle meshes, and empirically validate its invariant properties. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the useful industrial application of quadrilateral mesh generation.">

A key to successfully exploiting data scale is to design flexible models that can be supervised from various heterogeneous data sources produced by different researchers or vendors. To this end, we propose a simple yet powerful paradigm for seamlessly unifying different human pose and shape-related tasks and datasets. Our formulation is centered on the ability - both at training and test time - to query any arbitrary point of the human volume, and obtain its estimated location in 3D. We achieve this by learning a continuous neural field of body point localizer functions, each of which is a differently parameterized 3D heatmap-based convolutional point localizer (detector). For generating parametric output, we propose an efficient post-processing step for fitting SMPL-family body models to nonparametric joint and vertex predictions. With this approach, we can naturally exploit differently annotated data sources including mesh, 2D/3D skeleton and dense pose, without having to convert between them, and thereby train large-scale 3D human mesh and skeleton estimation models that outperform the state-of-the-art on several public benchmarks including 3DPW, EMDB and SSP-3D by a considerable margin.">

        <tr id="Legged robot locomotion on sand slopes is challenging due to the complex dynamics of granular media and how the lack of solid surfaces can hinder locomotion. A promising strategy, inspired by ghost crabs and other organisms in nature, is to strategically interact with rocks, debris, and other obstacles to facilitate movement. To provide legged robots with this ability, we present a novel approach that leverages avalanche dynamics to indirectly manipulate objects on a granular slope. We use a Vision Transformer (ViT) to process image representations of granular dynamics and robot excavation actions. The ViT predicts object movement, which we use to determine which leg excavation action to execute. We collect training data from 100 real physical trials and, at test time, deploy our trained model in novel settings. Experimental results suggest that our model can accurately predict object movements and achieve a success rate $\geq 80\%$ in a variety of manipulation tasks with up to four obstacles, and can also generalize to objects with different physics properties. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to leverage granular media avalanche dynamics to indirectly manipulate objects on granular slopes.

        <tr id="This article describes a novel fusion of a generative formal model for three-dimensional (3D) shapes with deep learning (DL) methods to understand the geometric structure of 3D objects and the relationships between their components, given a collection of unorganized point cloud measurements. Formal 3D shape models are implemented as shape grammar programs written in Procedural Shape Modeling Language (PSML). Users write PSML programs to describe complex objects, and DL networks estimate the configured free parameters of the program to generate 3D shapes. Users write PSML programs to enforce fundamental rules that define an object class and encode object attributes, including shapes, components, size, position, etc., into a parametric representation of objects. This fusion of the generative model with DL offers artificial intelligence (AI) models an opportunity to better understand the geometric organization of objects in terms of their components and their relationships to other objects. This approach allows human-in-the-loop control over DL estimates by specifying lists of candidate objects, the shape variations that each object can exhibit, and the level of detail or, equivalently, dimension of the latent representation of the shape. The results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over competing approaches.">

        <tr id="Due to the complex physical properties of granular materials, research on robot learning for manipulating such materials predominantly either disregards the consideration of their physical characteristics or uses surrogate models to approximate their physical properties. Learning to manipulate granular materials based on physical information obtained through precise modelling remains an unsolved problem. In this paper, we propose to address this challenge by constructing a differentiable physics simulator for granular materials based on the Taichi programming language and developing a learning framework accelerated by imperfect demonstrations that are generated via gradient-based optimisation on non-granular materials through our simulator. Experimental results show that our method trains three policies that, when chained, are capable of executing the task of transporting granular materials in both simulated and real-world scenarios, which existing popular deep reinforcement learning models fail to accomplish.">

        <tr id="Learning dexterous manipulation skills presents significant challenges due to complex nonlinear dynamics that underlie the interactions between objects and multi-fingered hands. Koopman operators have emerged as a robust method for modeling such nonlinear dynamics within a linear framework. However, current methods rely on runtime access to ground-truth (GT) object states, making them unsuitable for vision-based practical applications. Unlike image-to-action policies that implicitly learn visual features for control, we use a dynamics model, specifically the Koopman operator, to learn visually interpretable object features critical for robotic manipulation within a scene. We construct a Koopman operator using object features predicted by a feature extractor and utilize it to auto-regressively advance system states. We train the feature extractor to embed scene information into object features, thereby enabling the accurate propagation of robot trajectories. We evaluate our approach on simulated and real-world robot tasks, with results showing that it outperformed the model-based imitation learning NDP by 1.08$\times$ and the image-to-action Diffusion Policy by 1.16$\times$. The results suggest that our method maintains task success rates with learned features and extends applicability to real-world manipulation without GT object states.">

This is because of the under-determined nature of frame prediction; multiple potential futures can arise from a single current frame. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we revisit the idea of stochastic video generation that learns to capture uncertainty in frame prediction and explore its effectiveness for representation learning. Specifically, we design a framework that trains a stochastic frame prediction model to learn temporal information between frames. Moreover, to learn dense information within each frame, we introduce an auxiliary masked image modeling objective along with a shared decoder architecture. We find this architecture allows for combining both objectives in a synergistic and compute-efficient manner.

A realistic, scalable, and practical simulator of the driving world is highly desired. In this paper, we present an efficient solution based on generative models which learns the dynamics of the driving scenes. With this model, we can not only simulate the diverse futures of a given driving scenario but also generate a variety of driving scenarios conditioned on various prompts. Our innovative design allows the model to operate in both full-Autoregressive and partial-Autoregressive modes, significantly improving inference and training speed without sacrificing generative capability. This efficiency makes it ideal for being used as an online reactive environment for reinforcement learning, an evaluator for planning policies, and a high-fidelity simulator for testing. We evaluated our model against two real-world datasets: the Waymo motion dataset and the nuPlan dataset. On the simulation realism and scene generation benchmark, our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance. And in the planning benchmarks, our planner outperforms the prior arts. We conclude that the proposed generative model may serve as a foundation for a variety of motion planning tasks, including data generation, simulation, planning, and online training.

        <tr id="Modeling thermal states for complex space missions, such as the surface exploration of airless bodies, requires high computation, whether used in ground-based analysis for spacecraft design or during onboard reasoning for autonomous operations. For example, a finite-element thermal model with hundreds of elements can take significant time to simulate, which makes it unsuitable for onboard reasoning during time-sensitive scenarios such as descent and landing, proximity operations, or in-space assembly. Further, the lack of fast and accurate thermal modeling drives thermal designs to be more conservative and leads to spacecraft with larger mass and higher power budgets. The emerging paradigm of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) presents a class of hybrid modeling architectures that address this challenge by combining simplified physics models with machine learning (ML) models resulting in models which maintain both interpretability and robustness. Such techniques enable designs with reduced mass and power through onboard thermal-state estimation and control and may lead to improved onboard handling of off-nominal states, including unplanned down-time. The PIML model or hybrid model presented here consists of a neural network which predicts reduced nodalizations (distribution and size of coarse mesh) given on-orbit thermal load conditions, and subsequently a (relatively coarse) finite-difference model operates on this mesh to predict thermal states. We compare the computational performance and accuracy of the hybrid model to a data-driven neural net model, and a high-fidelity finite-difference model of a prototype Earth-orbiting small spacecraft. The PIML based active nodalization approach provides significantly better generalization than the neural net model and coarse mesh model, while reducing computing cost by up to 1.7x compared to the high-fidelity model.">

        <tr id="Behavior cloning (BC) currently stands as a dominant paradigm for learning real-world visual manipulation. However, in tasks that require locally corrective behaviors like multi-part assembly, learning robust policies purely from human demonstrations remains challenging. Reinforcement learning (RL) can mitigate these limitations by allowing policies to acquire locally corrective behaviors through task reward supervision and exploration. This paper explores the use of RL fine-tuning to improve upon BC-trained policies in precise manipulation tasks. We analyze and overcome technical challenges associated with using RL to directly train policy networks that incorporate modern architectural components like diffusion models and action chunking. We propose training residual policies on top of frozen BC-trained diffusion models using standard policy gradient methods and sparse rewards, an approach we call ResiP (Residual for Precise manipulation). Our experimental results demonstrate that this residual learning framework can significantly improve success rates beyond the base BC-trained models in high-precision assembly tasks by learning corrective actions. We also show that by combining ResiP with teacher-student distillation and visual domain randomization, our method can enable learning real-world policies for robotic assembly directly from RGB images.

To facilitate geometry-aware guidance in physical property estimation, we introduce a novel hybrid framework that leverages 3D Gaussian representation to not only capture explicit shapes but also enable the simulated continuum to deduce implicit shapes during training. We propose a new dynamic 3D Gaussian framework based on motion factorization to recover the object as 3D Gaussian point sets across different time states. Furthermore, we develop a coarse-to-fine filling strategy to generate the density fields of the object from the Gaussian reconstruction, allowing for the extraction of object continuums along with their surfaces and the integration of Gaussian attributes into these continuums. In addition to the extracted object surfaces, the Gaussian-informed continuum also enables the rendering of object masks during simulations, serving as implicit shape guidance for physical property estimation. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and metrics.

In this work, we address this gap by training shape-conditioned agents to reorient diverse objects in hand, relying purely on tactile feedback (via torque and position measurements of the fingers' joints). To achieve this, we propose a learning framework that exploits shape information in a reinforcement learning policy and a learned state estimator. We find that representing 3D shapes by vectors from a fixed set of basis points to the shape's surface, transformed by its predicted 3D pose, is especially helpful for learning dexterous in-hand manipulation. In simulation and real-world experiments, we show the reorientation of many objects with high success rates, on par with state-of-the-art results obtained with specialized single-object agents. Moreover, we show generalization to novel objects, achieving success rates of $\sim$90% even for non-convex shapes.">

However, in various scientific and engineering applications, the symmetries of dynamics are frequently discrete due to the boundary conditions. Thus, existing GNNs either overlook necessary symmetry, resulting in suboptimal representation ability, or impose excessive equivariance, which fails to generalize to unobserved symmetric dynamics. In this work, we propose a general Discrete Equivariant Graph Neural Network (DEGNN) that guarantees equivariance to a given discrete point group. Specifically, we show that such discrete equivariant message passing could be constructed by transforming geometric features into permutation-invariant embeddings. Through relaxing continuous equivariant constraints, DEGNN can employ more geometric feature combinations to approximate unobserved physical object interaction functions. Two implementation approaches of DEGNN are proposed based on ranking or pooling permutation-invariant functions. We apply DEGNN to various physical dynamics, ranging from particle, molecular, crowd to vehicle dynamics. In twenty scenarios, DEGNN significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we show that DEGNN is data efficient, learning with less data, and can generalize across scenarios such as unobserved orientation.">

        <tr id="Accurately modeling the mechanical behavior of materials is crucial for numerous engineering applications. The quality of these models depends directly on the accuracy of the constitutive law that defines the stress-strain relation. Discovering these constitutive material laws remains a significant challenge, in particular when only material deformation data is available. To address this challenge, unsupervised machine learning methods have been proposed. However, existing approaches have several limitations: they either fail to ensure that the learned constitutive relations are consistent with physical principles, or they rely on a predefined library of constitutive relations or manually crafted input features. These dependencies require significant expertise and specialized domain knowledge. Here, we introduce a machine learning approach called uLED, which overcomes the limitations by using the input convex neural network (ICNN) as the surrogate constitutive model. We improve the optimization strategy for training ICNN, allowing it to be trained end-to-end using direct strain invariants as input across various materials. Furthermore, we utilize the nodal force equilibrium at the internal domain as the training objective, which enables us to learn the constitutive relation solely from temporal displacement recordings. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a diverse range of material laws. We demonstrate that it is robust to a significant level of noise and that it converges to the ground truth with increasing data resolution. We also show that the model can be effectively trained using a displacement field from a subdomain of the test specimen and that the learned constitutive relation from one material sample is transferable to other samples with different geometries. The developed methodology provides an effective tool for discovering constitutive relations.">

        <tr id="Monocular dynamic reconstruction is a challenging and long-standing vision problem due to the highly ill-posed nature of the task. Existing approaches are limited in that they either depend on templates, are effective only in quasi-static scenes, or fail to model 3D motion explicitly. In this work, we introduce a method capable of reconstructing generic dynamic scenes, featuring explicit, full-sequence-long 3D motion, from casually captured monocular videos. We tackle the under-constrained nature of the problem with two key insights: First, we exploit the low-dimensional structure of 3D motion by representing scene motion with a compact set of SE3 motion bases. Each point's motion is expressed as a linear combination of these bases, facilitating soft decomposition of the scene into multiple rigidly-moving groups. Second, we utilize a comprehensive set of data-driven priors, including monocular depth maps and long-range 2D tracks, and devise a method to effectively consolidate these noisy supervisory signals, resulting in a globally consistent representation of the dynamic scene. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for both long-range 3D/2D motion estimation and novel view synthesis on dynamic scenes.

        <tr id="In this paper, we present a generic physics-informed generative model called MPDM that integrates multi-fidelity physics simulations with diffusion models. MPDM categorizes multi-fidelity physics simulations into inexpensive and expensive simulations, depending on computational costs. The inexpensive simulations, which can be obtained with low latency, directly inject contextual information into DDMs. Furthermore, when results from expensive simulations are available, MPDM refines the quality of generated samples via a guided diffusion process. This design separates the training of a denoising diffusion model from physics-informed conditional probability models, thus lending flexibility to practitioners. MPDM builds on Bayesian probabilistic models and is equipped with a theoretical guarantee that provides upper bounds on the Wasserstein distance between the sample and underlying true distribution. The probabilistic nature of MPDM also provides a convenient approach for uncertainty quantification in prediction. Our models excel in cases where physics simulations are imperfect and sometimes inaccessible. We use a numerical simulation in fluid dynamics and a case study in heat dynamics within laser-based metal powder deposition additive manufacturing to demonstrate how MPDM seamlessly integrates multi-idelity physics simulations and observations to obtain surrogates with superior predictive performance.">

        <tr id="Personalized 3D avatars require an animatable representation of digital humans. Doing so instantly from monocular videos offers scalability to broad class of users and wide-scale applications. In this paper, we present a fast, simple, yet effective method for creating animatable 3D digital humans from monocular videos. Our method utilizes the efficiency of Gaussian splatting to model both 3D geometry and appearance. However, we observed that naively optimizing Gaussian splats results in inaccurate geometry, thereby leading to poor animations. This work achieves and illustrates the need of accurate 3D mesh-type modelling of the human body for animatable digitization through Gaussian splats. This is achieved by developing a novel pipeline that benefits from three key aspects: (a) implicit modelling of surface's displacements and the color's spherical harmonics; (b) binding of 3D Gaussians to the respective triangular faces of the body template; (c) a novel technique to render normals followed by their auxiliary supervision. Our exhaustive experiments on three different benchmark datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art results of our method, in limited time settings. In fact, our method is faster by an order of magnitude (in terms of training time) than its closest competitor. At the same time, we achieve superior rendering and 3D reconstruction performance under the change of poses.">

        <tr id="Elucidating the intricate relationship between the structure and dynamics in the context of the glass transition has been a persistent challenge. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a pivotal tool, offering novel pathways to predict dynamic behaviors from structural descriptors. Notably, recent research has highlighted that the distance between the initial particle positions between the equilibrium positions substantially enhances the prediction of glassy dynamics. However, these methodologies have been limited in their ability to capture the directional aspects of these deviations from the equilibrium positions, which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the complex particle interactions within the cage dynamics. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel structural parameter: the vectorial displacement of particles from their initial configuration to their equilibrium positions. Recognizing the inadequacy of current ML models in effectively handling such vectorial parameters, we have developed an Equivariance-Constrained Invariant Graph Neural Network (EIGNN). This innovative model not only bolsters the descriptive capacity of conventional rotation-invariant models but also streamlines the computational demands associated with rotation-equivariant graph neural networks. Our rigorous experimental validation on 3D glassy system from GlassBench dataset has yielded compelling evidence that the EIGNN model significantly enhance the correlation between structural representation and dynamic properties.">

Identifying more efficient alternatives to dense matrices has enormous potential for building more compute-efficient models, as exemplified by the success of convolutional networks in the image domain. In this work, we systematically explore structured matrices as replacements for dense matrices. We show that different structures often require drastically different initialization scales and learning rates, which are crucial to performance, especially as models scale. Using insights from the Maximal Update Parameterization, we determine the optimal scaling for initialization and learning rates of these unconventional layers. Finally, we measure the scaling laws of different structures to compare how quickly their performance improves with compute. We propose a novel matrix family containing Monarch matrices, the Block Tensor-Train (BTT), which we show performs better than dense matrices for the same compute on multiple tasks. On CIFAR-10/100 with augmentation, BTT achieves exponentially lower training loss than dense when training MLPs and ViTs. BTT matches dense ViT-S/32 performance on ImageNet-1k with 3.8 times less compute and is more efficient than dense for training small GPT-2 language models.">

        <tr id="Predicting the trajectories of systems with unknown dynamics (\textit{i.e.} the governing rules) is crucial in various research fields, including physics and biology. This challenge has gathered significant attention from diverse communities. Most existing works focus on learning fixed system dynamics within one single system. However, real-world applications often involve multiple systems with different types of dynamics or evolving systems with non-stationary dynamics (dynamics shifts). When data from those systems are continuously collected and sequentially fed to machine learning models for training, these models tend to be biased toward the most recently learned dynamics, leading to catastrophic forgetting of previously observed/learned system dynamics. To this end, we aim to learn system dynamics via continual learning. Specifically, we present a novel framework of Mode-switching Graph ODE (MS-GODE), which can continually learn varying dynamics and encode the system-specific dynamics into binary masks over the model parameters. During the inference stage, the model can select the most confident mask based on the observational data to identify the system and predict future trajectories accordingly. Empirically, we systematically investigate the task configurations and compare the proposed MS-GODE with state-of-the-art techniques. More importantly, we construct a novel benchmark of biological dynamic systems, featuring diverse systems with disparate dynamics and significantly enriching the research field of machine learning for dynamic systems.">

        <tr id="We present personalized Gaussian Eigen Models (GEMs) for human heads, a novel method that compresses dynamic 3D Gaussians into low-dimensional linear spaces. Our approach is inspired by the seminal work of Blanz and Vetter, where a mesh-based 3D morphable model (3DMM) is constructed from registered meshes. Based on dynamic 3D Gaussians, we create a lower-dimensional representation of primitives that applies to most 3DGS head avatars. Specifically, we propose a universal method to distill the appearance of a mesh-controlled UNet Gaussian avatar using an ensemble of linear eigenbasis. We replace heavy CNN-based architectures with a single linear layer improving speed and enabling a range of real-time downstream applications. To create a particular facial expression, one simply needs to perform a dot product between the eigen coefficients and the distilled basis. This efficient method removes the requirement for an input mesh during testing, enhancing simplicity and speed in expression generation. This process is highly efficient and supports real-time rendering on everyday devices, leveraging the effectiveness of standard Gaussian Splatting. In addition, we demonstrate how the GEM can be controlled using a ResNet-based regression architecture. We show and compare self-reenactment and cross-person reenactment to state-of-the-art 3D avatar methods, demonstrating higher quality and better control.

        <tr id="Symmetry is one of the most central concepts in physics, and it is no surprise that it has also been widely adopted as an inductive bias for machine-learning models applied to the physical sciences. This is especially true for models targeting the properties of matter at the atomic scale. Both established and state-of-the-art approaches, with almost no exceptions, are built to be exactly equivariant to translations, permutations, and rotations of the atoms. Incorporating symmetries -- rotations in particular -- constrains the model design space and implies more complicated architectures that are often also computationally demanding. There are indications that non-symmetric models can easily learn symmetries from data, and that doing so can even be beneficial for the accuracy of the model. We put a model that obeys rotational invariance only approximately to the test, in realistic scenarios involving simulations of gas-phase, liquid, and solid water. We focus specifically on physical observables that are likely to be affected -- directly or indirectly -- by symmetry breaking, finding negligible consequences when the model is used in an interpolative, bulk, regime. Even for extrapolative gas-phase predictions, the model remains very stable, even though symmetry artifacts are noticeable. We also discuss strategies that can be used to systematically reduce the magnitude of symmetry breaking when it occurs, and assess their impact on the convergence of observables.">

Natural language serves as a flexible interface for controlling these models, allowing expert and non-expert users to quickly create and edit their animations. Many recent physics-based animation methods, including those that use text interfaces, train control policies using reinforcement learning (RL). However, scaling these methods beyond several hundred motions has remained challenging. Meanwhile, kinematic animation models are able to successfully learn from thousands of diverse motions by leveraging supervised learning methods. Inspired by these successes, in this work we introduce SuperPADL, a scalable framework for physics-based text-to-motion that leverages both RL and supervised learning to train controllers on thousands of diverse motion clips. SuperPADL is trained in stages using progressive distillation, starting with a large number of specialized experts using RL. These experts are then iteratively distilled into larger, more robust policies using a combination of reinforcement learning and supervised learning. Our final SuperPADL controller is trained on a dataset containing over 5000 skills and runs in real time on a consumer GPU. Moreover, our policy can naturally transition between skills, allowing for users to interactively craft multi-stage animations. We experimentally demonstrate that SuperPADL significantly outperforms RL-based baselines at this large data scale.">

        <tr id="Different from human nature, it is still common practice today for vision tasks to train deep learning models only initially and on fixed datasets. A variety of approaches have recently addressed handling continual data streams. However, extending these methods to manage out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios has not effectively been investigated. On the other hand, it has recently been shown that non-continual neural mesh models exhibit strong performance in generalizing to such OOD scenarios. To leverage this decisive property in a continual learning setting, we propose incremental neural mesh models that can be extended with new meshes over time. In addition, we present a latent space initialization strategy that enables us to allocate feature space for future unseen classes in advance and a positional regularization term that forces the features of the different classes to consistently stay in respective latent space regions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on the Pascal3D and ObjectNet3D datasets and show that our approach outperforms the baselines for classification by $2-6\%$ in the in-domain and by $6-50\%$ in the OOD setting. Our work also presents the first incremental learning approach for pose estimation. Our code and model can be found at https://github.com/Fischer-Tom/iNeMo.">

        <tr id="Mirroring the complex structures and diverse functions of natural organisms is a long-standing challenge in robotics. Modern fabrication techniques have dramatically expanded feasible hardware, yet deploying these systems requires control software to translate desired motions into actuator commands. While conventional robots can easily be modeled as rigid links connected via joints, it remains an open challenge to model and control bio-inspired robots that are often multi-material or soft, lack sensing capabilities, and may change their material properties with use. Here, we introduce Neural Jacobian Fields, an architecture that autonomously learns to model and control robots from vision alone. Our approach makes no assumptions about the robot's materials, actuation, or sensing, requires only a single camera for control, and learns to control the robot without expert intervention by observing the execution of random commands. We demonstrate our method on a diverse set of robot manipulators, varying in actuation, materials, fabrication, and cost. Our approach achieves accurate closed-loop control and recovers the causal dynamic structure of each robot. By enabling robot control with a generic camera as the only sensor, we anticipate our work will dramatically broaden the design space of robotic systems and serve as a starting point for lowering the barrier to robotic automation.">

In contrast to previous approaches that rely on a unified grid to represent the belief state of the scene, we propose dedicated representations to disentangle dynamic agents and static scene elements. This allows us to explicitly compensate for the effect of both ego and object motion between consecutive time steps and to flexibly propagate the belief state through time. Furthermore, dynamic objects can not only attend to the input camera images, but also directly benefit from the inferred static scene structure via a novel dynamic-static cross-attention. Extensive experiments on the challenging nuScenes benchmark demonstrate the benefits of the proposed dual-stream design, especially for modelling highly dynamic agents in the scene, and highlight the improved temporal consistency of our approach. Our method titled DualAD not only outperforms independently trained single-task networks, but also improves over previous state-of-the-art end-to-end models by a large margin on all tasks along the functional chain of driving.">

        <tr id="The effectiveness of neural processes (NPs) in modelling posterior prediction maps -- the mapping from data to posterior predictive distributions -- has significantly improved since their inception. This improvement can be attributed to two principal factors: (1) advancements in the architecture of permutation invariant set functions, which are intrinsic to all NPs; and (2) leveraging symmetries present in the true posterior predictive map, which are problem dependent. Transformers are a notable development in permutation invariant set functions, and their utility within NPs has been demonstrated through the family of models we refer to as TNPs. Despite significant interest in TNPs, little attention has been given to incorporating symmetries. Notably, the posterior prediction maps for data that are stationary -- a common assumption in spatio-temporal modelling -- exhibit translation equivariance. In this paper, we introduce of a new family of translation equivariant TNPs that incorporate translation equivariance. Through an extensive range of experiments on synthetic and real-world spatio-temporal data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TE-TNPs relative to their non-translation-equivariant counterparts and other NP baselines.">

        <tr id="Computing Jacobians with automatic differentiation is ubiquitous in many scientific domains such as machine learning, computational fluid dynamics, robotics and finance. Even small savings in the number of computations or memory usage in Jacobian computations can already incur massive savings in energy consumption and runtime. While there exist many methods that allow for such savings, they generally trade computational efficiency for approximations of the exact Jacobian. In this paper, we present a novel method to optimize the number of necessary multiplications for Jacobian computation by leveraging deep reinforcement learning (RL) and a concept called cross-country elimination while still computing the exact Jacobian. Cross-country elimination is a framework for automatic differentiation that phrases Jacobian accumulation as ordered elimination of all vertices on the computational graph where every elimination incurs a certain computational cost. We formulate the search for the optimal elimination order that minimizes the number of necessary multiplications as a single player game which is played by an RL agent. We demonstrate that this method achieves up to 33% improvements over state-of-the-art methods on several relevant tasks taken from diverse domains. Furthermore, we show that these theoretical gains translate into actual runtime improvements by providing a cross-country elimination interpreter in JAX that can efficiently execute the obtained elimination orders.">

One of the main criticisms to machine learned potentials is that the energy inferred by the network is not as interpretable as in more traditional approaches where a simpler functional form is used. Here we address this problem by extending tools recently proposed in the nascent field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to coarse-grained potentials based on graph neural networks (GNN). We demonstrate the approach on three different coarse-grained systems including two fluids (methane and water) and the protein NTL9. On these examples, we show that the neural network potentials can be in practice decomposed in relevance contributions to different orders, that can be directly interpreted and provide physical insights on the systems of interest.">

        <tr id="Manipulating objects without grasping them facilitates complex tasks, known as non-prehensile manipulation. Most previous methods are limited to learning a single skill to manipulate objects with primitive shapes and are unserviceable for flexible object manipulation that requires a combination of multiple skills. We explore skill-unconstrained non-prehensile manipulation and propose a Multi-stage Reinforcement Learning for Non-prehensile Manipulation (MRLNM), which calculates an intermediate state between the initial and goal states and divides the task into multiple stages for sequential learning. At each stage, the policy takes the desired 6-DOF object pose as the goal, and proposes a spatially-continuous action, allowing the robot to explore arbitrary skills to accomplish the task. To handle objects with different shapes, we propose a State-Goal Fusion Representation (SGF-Representation) to represent observations and goals as point clouds with motion, which improves the policy's perception of scene layout and task goal. To improve sample efficiency, we propose a Spatially-Reachable Distance Metric (SR-Distance) to approximately measure the shortest distance between two points without intersecting the scene. We evaluate MRLNM on an occluded grasping task which aims to grasp the object in initially occluded configurations. MRLNM demonstrates generalization to unseen objects with shapes outside the training distribution and can be transferred to the real world with zero-shot transfer, achieving a 95% success rate.">

In simulation, we show that Flow Matching is more appropriate for robotics than Diffusion and traditional behavior cloning. On a real full-size humanoid robot (Talos), we demonstrate that our approach can learn a whole-body non-prehensile box-pushing task and that the robot can close dishwasher drawers by adding contacts with its free hand when needed for balance.

Both factors limit the application of these methods in real-world scenarios. In this work, we present a pipeline that does not require CAD models and allows training a state-of-the-art pose estimator requiring only a small set of real images as input. Our method is based on a NeuS2 object representation, that we learn through a semi-automated procedure based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and object-agnostic segmentation. We exploit the novel-view synthesis ability of NeuS2 and simple cut-and-paste augmentation to automatically generate photorealistic object renderings, which we use to train the correspondence-based SurfEmb pose estimator. We evaluate our method on the LINEMOD-Occlusion dataset, extensively studying the impact of its individual components and showing competitive performance with respect to approaches based on CAD models and PBR data. We additionally demonstrate the ease of use and effectiveness of our pipeline on self-collected real-world objects, showing that our method outperforms state-of-the-art CAD-model-free approaches, with better accuracy and robustness to mild occlusions.

What makes this challenge even harder to solve is that, usually, the object has not been observed previously, and the only information that we can get from it is a stream of RGB camera data. In this study, we explore the use of deep learning techniques to solve this nonlinear identification problem. We specifically focus on extracting dynamic models of simple deformable objects from the high-dimensional sensor input coming from an RGB camera. We investigate a two-stage approach to achieve this goal. First, we train a variational autoencoder to extract an extremely low-dimensional representation of the object configuration. Then, we learn a dynamic model that predicts the evolution of these latent space variables. The proposed architecture can accurately predict the object's state up to one second into the future.">

In this paper we present a single Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) surrogate that outperforms traditional reservoir simulators by the ability to predict pressures and saturations on varying permeability fields, well locations, well controls, and number of wells. The maximum-mean relative error of 95\% of pressure and saturation predictions is less than 5\%. This is achieved by employing a simple yet very effective data augmentation technique that reduces the dataset size by 75\% and reduces overfitting. Also, constructing the input tensor in a binary fashion enables predictions on unseen well locations, well controls, and number of wells. Such model can accelerate history matching and reservoir characterization procedures by several orders of magnitude. The ability to predict on new well locations, well controls, and number of wells enables highly efficient reservoir management and optimization.">

        <tr id="This paper presents a sequence of two approaches for the data-driven control-oriented modeling of networked systems, i.e., the systems that involve many interacting dynamical components. First, a novel deep learning approach named the weak Latent Dynamics Model (wLDM) is developed for learning generic nonlinear dynamics with control. Leveraging the weak form, the wLDM enables more numerically stable and computationally efficient training as well as more accurate prediction, when compared to conventional methods such as neural ordinary differential equations. Building upon the wLDM framework, we propose the weak Graph Koopman Bilinear Form (wGKBF) model, which integrates geometric deep learning and Koopman theory to learn latent space dynamics for networked systems, especially for the challenging cases having multiple timescales. The effectiveness of the wLDM framework and wGKBF model are demonstrated on three example systems of increasing complexity - a controlled double pendulum, the stiff Brusselator dynamics, and an electrified aircraft energy system. These numerical examples show that the wLDM and wGKBF achieve superior predictive accuracy and training efficiency as compared to baseline models. Parametric studies provide insights into the effects of hyperparameters in the weak form. The proposed framework shows the capability to efficiently capture control-dependent dynamics in these systems, including stiff dynamics and multi-physics interactions, offering a promising direction for learning control-oriented models of complex networked systems.">

        <tr id="Implicit functions such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), occupancy networks, and signed distance functions (SDFs) have become pivotal in computer vision for reconstructing detailed object shapes from sparse views. Achieving optimal performance with these models can be challenging due to the extreme sparsity of inputs and distribution shifts induced by data corruptions. To this end, large, noise-free synthetic datasets can serve as shape priors to help models fill in gaps, but the resulting reconstructions must be approached with caution. Uncertainty estimation is crucial for assessing the quality of these reconstructions, particularly in identifying areas where the model is uncertain about the parts it has inferred from the prior. In this paper, we introduce Dropsembles, a novel method for uncertainty estimation in tuned implicit functions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through a series of experiments, starting with toy examples and progressing to a real-world scenario. Specifically, we train a Convolutional Occupancy Network on synthetic anatomical data and test it on low-resolution MRI segmentations of the lumbar spine. Our results show that Dropsembles achieve the accuracy and calibration levels of deep ensembles but with significantly less computational cost.">

        <tr id="The enduring legacy of Euclidean geometry underpins classical machine learning, which, for decades, has been primarily developed for data lying in Euclidean space. Yet, modern machine learning increasingly encounters richly structured data that is inherently nonEuclidean. This data can exhibit intricate geometric, topological and algebraic structure: from the geometry of the curvature of space-time, to topologically complex interactions between neurons in the brain, to the algebraic transformations describing symmetries of physical systems. Extracting knowledge from such non-Euclidean data necessitates a broader mathematical perspective. Echoing the 19th-century revolutions that gave rise to non-Euclidean geometry, an emerging line of research is redefining modern machine learning with non-Euclidean structures. Its goal: generalizing classical methods to unconventional data types with geometry, topology, and algebra. In this review, we provide an accessible gateway to this fast-growing field and propose a graphical taxonomy that integrates recent advances into an intuitive unified framework. We subsequently extract insights into current challenges and highlight exciting opportunities for future development in this field.">

We also annotate HIMO with detailed textual descriptions and temporal segments, benchmarking two novel tasks of HOI synthesis conditioned on either the whole text prompt or the segmented text prompts as fine-grained timeline control. To address these novel tasks, we propose a dual-branch conditional diffusion model with a mutual interaction module for HOI synthesis. Besides, an auto-regressive generation pipeline is also designed to obtain smooth transitions between HOI segments.

In this work, we propose a Physics- Inspired Neural Network (PINN) named HDNet, which performs a Helmholtz decomposition of an arbitrary flow field, i.e., it decomposes the input flow into a divergence-only and a curl-only component. HDNet can be trained exclusively on synthetic data generated by reverse Helmholtz decomposition, which we call Helmholtz synthesis.

In this study, we address the realizability issue via a new physics-based loss function that penalizes non-realizable results during training, thereby embedding a preference for realizable predictions into the model. Additionally, we propose a new framework for data-driven turbulence modelling which retains the stability and conditioning of optimal eddy viscosity-based approaches while embedding equivariance. Several modifications to the tensor basis neural network to enhance training and testing stability are proposed. We demonstrate the conditioning, stability, and generalization of the new framework and model architecture on three flows: flow over a flat plate, flow over periodic hills, and flow through a square duct. The realizability-informed loss function is demonstrated to significantly increase the number of realizable predictions made by the model when generalizing to a new flow configuration. Altogether, the proposed framework enables the training of stable and equivariant anisotropy mappings, with more physically realizable predictions on new data.

While an expert human can do well at making such time-sensitive decisions, the development of safe and efficient game-theoretic trajectory planners capable of rapidly reasoning discrete options is yet to be fully addressed. The recently developed nonlinear opinion dynamics (NOD) show promise in enabling fast opinion formation and avoiding safety-critical deadlocks. However, it remains an open challenge to determine the model parameters of NOD automatically and adaptively, accounting for the ever-changing environment of interaction. In this work, we propose for the first time a learning-based, game-theoretic approach to synthesize a Neural NOD model from expert demonstrations, given as a dataset containing (possibly incomplete) state and action trajectories of interacting agents. The learned NOD can be used by existing dynamic game solvers to plan decisively while accounting for the predicted change of other agents' intents, thus enabling situational awareness in planning. We demonstrate Neural NOD's ability to make fast and robust decisions in a simulated autonomous racing example, leading to tangible improvements in safety and overtaking performance over state-of-the-art data-driven game-theoretic planning methods.">

We compare this approach with the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and demonstrate that it can generalize over the space of PDE parameters, despite having a higher prediction error for individual parameter values compared to the FNO.

To address this, we compare various pretraining methods without optimizing architecture choices to characterize pretraining dynamics on different models and datasets as well as to understand its scaling and generalization behavior. We find that pretraining is highly dependent on model and dataset choices, but in general transfer learning or physics-based pretraining strategies work best. In addition, pretraining performance can be further improved by using data augmentations. Lastly, pretraining is additionally beneficial when fine-tuning in scarce data regimes or when generalizing to downstream data similar to the pretraining distribution.

        <tr id="Given the remarkable results of motion synthesis with diffusion models, a natural question arises: how can we effectively leverage these models for motion editing? Existing diffusion-based motion editing methods overlook the profound potential of the prior embedded within the weights of pre-trained models, which enables manipulating the latent feature space; hence, they primarily center on handling the motion space. In this work, we explore the attention mechanism of pre-trained motion diffusion models. We uncover the roles and interactions of attention elements in capturing and representing intricate human motion patterns, and carefully integrate these elements to transfer a leader motion to a follower one while maintaining the nuanced characteristics of the follower, resulting in zero-shot motion transfer. Editing features associated with selected motions allows us to confront a challenge observed in prior motion diffusion approaches, which use general directives (e.g., text, music) for editing, ultimately failing to convey subtle nuances effectively. Our work is inspired by how a monkey closely imitates what it sees while maintaining its unique motion patterns; hence we call it Monkey See, Monkey Do, and dub it MoMo. Employing our technique enables accomplishing tasks such as synthesizing out-of-distribution motions, style transfer, and spatial editing. Furthermore, diffusion inversion is seldom employed for motions; as a result, editing efforts focus on generated motions, limiting the editability of real ones. MoMo harnesses motion inversion, extending its application to both real and generated motions. Experimental results show the advantage of our approach over the current art. In particular, unlike methods tailored for specific applications through training, our approach is applied at inference time, requiring no training.

Despite recent progress in this field utilizing deep learning and motion capture data, existing methods are always limited to specific motion categories, environments, and styles. This poor generalizability can be partially attributed to the difficulty and expense of collecting large-scale and high-quality motion data. At the same time, foundation models trained with internet-scale image and text data have demonstrated surprising world knowledge and reasoning ability for various downstream tasks. Utilizing these foundation models may help with human motion synthesis, which some recent works have superficially explored. However, these methods didn't fully unveil the foundation models' potential for this task and only support several simple actions and environments. In this paper, we for the first time, without any motion data, explore open-set human motion synthesis using natural language instructions as user control signals based on MLLMs across any motion task and environment. Our framework can be split into two stages: 1) sequential keyframe generation by utilizing MLLMs as a keyframe designer and animator; 2) motion filling between keyframes through interpolation and motion tracking. Our method can achieve general human motion synthesis for many downstream tasks. The promising results demonstrate the worth of mocap-free human motion synthesis aided by MLLMs and pave the way for future research.">

        <tr id="Recently, Conditional Neural Fields (NeFs) have emerged as a powerful modelling paradigm for PDEs, by learning solutions as flows in the latent space of the Conditional NeF. Although benefiting from favourable properties of NeFs such as grid-agnosticity and space-time-continuous dynamics modelling, this approach limits the ability to impose known constraints of the PDE on the solutions -- e.g. symmetries or boundary conditions -- in favour of modelling flexibility. Instead, we propose a space-time continuous NeF-based solving framework that - by preserving geometric information in the latent space - respects known symmetries of the PDE. We show that modelling solutions as flows of pointclouds over the group of interest $G$ improves generalization and data-efficiency. We validated that our framework readily generalizes to unseen spatial and temporal locations, as well as geometric transformations of the initial conditions - where other NeF-based PDE forecasting methods fail - and improve over baselines in a number of challenging geometries.">

        <tr id="We propose a new framework for creating and easily manipulating 3D models of arbitrary objects using casually captured videos. Our core ingredient is a novel hierarchy deformation model, which captures motions of objects with a tree-structured bones. Our hierarchy system decomposes motions based on the granularity and reveals the correlations between parts without exploiting any prior structural knowledge. We further propose to regularize the bones to be positioned at the basis of motions, centers of parts, sufficiently covering related surfaces of the part. This is achieved by our bone occupancy function, which identifies whether a given 3D point is placed within the bone. Coupling the proposed components, our framework offers several clear advantages: (1) users can obtain animatable 3D models of the arbitrary objects in improved quality from their casual videos, (2) users can manipulate 3D models in an intuitive manner with minimal costs, and (3) users can interactively add or delete control points as necessary. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on diverse instances, in reconstruction quality, interpretability and easier manipulation.

As these models are trained using large-scale unsupervised data, it has become crucial to adapt these models to specific downstream tasks. Adapting these models via supervised fine-tuning requires collecting target datasets of videos, which is challenging and tedious. In this work, we utilize pre-trained reward models that are learned via preferences on top of powerful vision discriminative models to adapt video diffusion models. These models contain dense gradient information with respect to generated RGB pixels, which is critical to efficient learning in complex search spaces, such as videos. We show that backpropagating gradients from these reward models to a video diffusion model can allow for compute and sample efficient alignment of the video diffusion model. We show results across a variety of reward models and video diffusion models, demonstrating that our approach can learn much more efficiently in terms of reward queries and computation than prior gradient-free approaches.

        <tr id="Ensemble models often improve generalization performances in challenging tasks. Yet, traditional techniques based on prediction averaging incur three well-known disadvantages: the computational overhead of training multiple models, increased latency, and memory requirements at test time. To address these issues, the Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) technique maintains a running average of model parameters from a specific epoch onward. Despite its potential benefits, maintaining a running average of parameters can hinder generalization, as an underlying running model begins to overfit. Conversely, an inadequately chosen starting point can render SWA more susceptible to underfitting compared to an underlying running model. In this work, we propose Adaptive Stochastic Weight Averaging (ASWA) technique that updates a running average of model parameters, only when generalization performance is improved on the validation dataset. Hence, ASWA can be seen as a combination of SWA with the early stopping technique, where the former accepts all updates on a parameter ensemble model and the latter rejects any update on an underlying running model. We conducted extensive experiments ranging from image classification to multi-hop reasoning over knowledge graphs. Our experiments over 11 benchmark datasets with 7 baseline models suggest that ASWA leads to a statistically better generalization across models and datasets">

        <tr id="We tackle the problem of text-driven 3D generation from a geometry alignment perspective. We aim at the generation of multiple objects which are consistent in terms of semantics and geometry. Recent methods based on Score Distillation have succeeded in distilling the knowledge from 2D diffusion models to high-quality objects represented by 3D neural radiance fields. These methods handle multiple text queries separately, and therefore, the resulting objects have a high variability in object pose and structure. However, in some applications such as geometry editing, it is desirable to obtain aligned objects. In order to achieve alignment, we propose to optimize the continuous trajectories between the aligned objects, by modeling a space of linear pairwise interpolations of the textual embeddings with a single NeRF representation. We demonstrate that similar objects, consisting of semantically corresponding parts, can be well aligned in 3D space without costly modifications to the generation process. We provide several practical scenarios including mesh editing and object hybridization that benefit from geometry alignment and experimentally demonstrate the efficiency of our method. https://voyleg.github.io/a3d/">

To handle this problem, the present work introduces an innovative approach that combines autoencoder deep neural networks with the probabilistic regression capabilities of Gaussian processes. The autoencoder provides a low-dimensional representation of the solution space, while the Gaussian process is a Bayesian method that provides a probabilistic mapping between the low-dimensional inputs and outputs. We validate the proposed framework for its application to surrogate modeling of non-linear finite element simulations. Our findings highlight that the proposed framework is computationally efficient as well as accurate in predicting non-linear deformations of solid bodies subjected to external forces, all the while providing insightful uncertainty assessments.">

        <tr id="Learning predictive world models is essential for enhancing the planning capabilities of reinforcement learning agents. Notably, the MuZero-style algorithms, based on the value equivalence principle and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), have achieved superhuman performance in various domains. However, in environments that require capturing long-term dependencies, MuZero's performance deteriorates rapidly. We identify that this is partially due to the \textit{entanglement} of latent representations with historical information, which results in incompatibility with the auxiliary self-supervised state regularization. To overcome this limitation, we present \textit{UniZero}, a novel approach that \textit{disentangles} latent states from implicit latent history using a transformer-based latent world model. By concurrently predicting latent dynamics and decision-oriented quantities conditioned on the learned latent history, UniZero enables joint optimization of the long-horizon world model and policy, facilitating broader and more efficient planning in latent space. We demonstrate that UniZero, even with single-frame inputs, matches or surpasses the performance of MuZero-style algorithms on the Atari 100k benchmark. Furthermore, it significantly outperforms prior baselines in benchmarks that require long-term memory. Lastly, we validate the effectiveness and scalability of our design choices through extensive ablation studies, visual analyses, and multi-task learning results.

Physics-informed convolutional neural networks (PICNNs) extend PINNs by leveraging CNNs for enhanced generalization and efficiency. However, current PICNNs depend on manual design, and inappropriate designs may not effectively solve PDEs. Furthermore, due to the diversity of physical problems, the ideal network architectures and loss functions vary across different PDEs. It is impractical to find the optimal PICNN architecture and loss function for each specific physical problem through extensive manual experimentation. To surmount these challenges, this paper uses automated machine learning (AutoML) to automatically and efficiently search for the loss functions and network architectures of PICNNs. We introduce novel search spaces for loss functions and network architectures and propose a two-stage search strategy. The first stage focuses on searching for factors and residual adjustment operations that influence the loss function, while the second stage aims to find the best CNN architecture. Experimental results show that our automatic searching method significantly outperforms the manually-designed model on multiple datasets.">

        <tr id="Trajectory generation is a pivotal task in autonomous driving. Recent studies have introduced the autoregressive paradigm, leveraging the state transition model to approximate future trajectory distributions. This paradigm closely mirrors the real-world trajectory generation process and has achieved notable success. However, its potential is limited by the ineffective representation of realistic trajectories within the redundant state space. To address this limitation, we propose the Kinematic-Driven Generative Model for Realistic Agent Simulation (KiGRAS). Instead of modeling in the state space, KiGRAS factorizes the driving scene into action probability distributions at each time step, providing a compact space to represent realistic driving patterns. By establishing physical causality from actions (cause) to trajectories (effect) through the kinematic model, KiGRAS eliminates massive redundant trajectories. All states derived from actions in the cause space are constrained to be physically feasible. Furthermore, redundant trajectories representing identical action sequences are mapped to the same representation, reflecting their underlying actions. This approach significantly reduces task complexity and ensures physical feasibility. KiGRAS achieves state-of-the-art performance in Waymo's SimAgents Challenge, ranking first on the WOMD leaderboard with significantly fewer parameters than other models.

To tackle these challenges, we introduce ParamsDrag, a model that facilitates parameter space exploration through direct interaction with visualizations.

Second, by directly dragging structure-related features in the visualizations, users can intuitively understand the controlling effect of different parameters. Third, with the understanding from the earlier step, users can steer ParamsDrag to produce dynamic visual outcomes.

Such constraints could be physics-based (e.g., satisfying a PDE), geometric (e.g., respecting symmetry), or semantic (e.g., including a particular number of objects). When the training data all satisfy a certain constraint, enforcing this constraint on a diffusion model not only improves its distribution-matching accuracy but also makes it more reliable for generating valid synthetic data and solving constrained inverse problems. However, existing methods for constrained diffusion models are inflexible with different types of constraints. Recent work proposed to learn mirror diffusion models (MDMs) in an unconstrained space defined by a mirror map and to impose the constraint with an inverse mirror map, but analytical mirror maps are challenging to derive for complex constraints. We propose neural approximate mirror maps (NAMMs) for general constraints. Our approach only requires a differentiable distance function from the constraint set. We learn an approximate mirror map that pushes data into an unconstrained space and a corresponding approximate inverse that maps data back to the constraint set. A generative model, such as an MDM, can then be trained in the learned mirror space and its samples restored to the constraint set by the inverse map. We validate our approach on a variety of constraints, showing that compared to an unconstrained diffusion model, a NAMM-based MDM substantially improves constraint satisfaction. We also demonstrate how existing diffusion-based inverse-problem solvers can be easily applied in the learned mirror space to solve constrained inverse problems.">

Recently, masked video modeling methods have shown promising scalability, yet fall short in capturing higher-level semantics due to reconstructing predefined low-level targets such as pixels. To tackle this, we present Sinkhorn-guided Masked Video Modelling (SIGMA), a novel video pretraining method that jointly learns the video model in addition to a target feature space using a projection network. However, this simple modification means that the regular L2 reconstruction loss will lead to trivial solutions as both networks are jointly optimized. As a solution, we distribute features of space-time tubes evenly across a limited number of learnable clusters. By posing this as an optimal transport problem, we enforce high entropy in the generated features across the batch, infusing semantic and temporal meaning into the feature space. The resulting cluster assignments are used as targets for a symmetric prediction task where the video model predicts cluster assignment of the projection network and vice versa. Experimental results on ten datasets across three benchmarks validate the effectiveness of SIGMA in learning more performant, temporally-aware, and robust video representations improving upon state-of-the-art methods.

This reduction in model complexity allows coarse-grained molecular simulations to reach increased spatial and temporal scales compared to corresponding all-atom models. A core challenge in coarse-graining is to construct a force field that represents the interactions in the new representation in a way that preserves the atomistic-level properties. Many approaches to building coarse-grained force fields have limited transferability between different thermodynamic conditions as a result of averaging over internal fluctuations at a specific thermodynamic state point. Here, we use a graph-convolutional neural network architecture, the Hierarchically Interacting Particle Neural Network with Tensor Sensitivity (HIP-NN-TS), to develop a highly automated training pipeline for coarse grained force fields which allows for studying the transferability of coarse-grained models based on the force-matching approach. We show that this approach not only yields highly accurate force fields, but also that these force fields are more transferable through a variety of thermodynamic conditions.

        <tr id="Neural implicit functions have demonstrated significant importance in various areas such as computer vision, graphics. Their advantages include the ability to represent complex shapes and scenes with high fidelity, smooth interpolation capabilities, and continuous representations. Despite these benefits, the development and analysis of implicit functions have been limited by the lack of comprehensive datasets and the substantial computational resources required for their implementation and evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce"Implicit-Zoo": a large-scale dataset requiring thousands of GPU training days designed to facilitate research and development in this field. Our dataset includes diverse 2D and 3D scenes, such as CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1K, and Cityscapes for 2D image tasks, and the OmniObject3D dataset for 3D vision tasks. We ensure high quality through strict checks, refining or filtering out low-quality data. Using Implicit-Zoo, we showcase two immediate benefits as it enables to: (1) learn token locations for transformer models; (2) directly regress 3D cameras poses of 2D images with respect to NeRF models. This in turn leads to an improved performance in all three task of image classification, semantic segmentation, and 3D pose regression, thereby unlocking new avenues for research.">

        <tr id="World models are receiving increasing attention in autonomous driving for their ability to predict potential future scenarios. In this paper, we present BEVWorld, a novel approach that tokenizes multimodal sensor inputs into a unified and compact Bird's Eye View (BEV) latent space for environment modeling. The world model consists of two parts: the multi-modal tokenizer and the latent BEV sequence diffusion model. The multi-modal tokenizer first encodes multi-modality information and the decoder is able to reconstruct the latent BEV tokens into LiDAR and image observations by ray-casting rendering in a self-supervised manner. Then the latent BEV sequence diffusion model predicts future scenarios given action tokens as conditions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BEVWorld in autonomous driving tasks, showcasing its capability in generating future scenes and benefiting downstream tasks such as perception and motion prediction.

This article focuses on neural topology optimization (neural TO), which leverages NNs to reparameterize the decision space and reshape the optimization landscape. While the method is still in its infancy, our analysis tools reveal critical insights into the NNs' impact on the optimization process. We demonstrate that the choice of NN architecture significantly influences the objective landscape and the optimizer's path to an optimum. Notably, NNs introduce non-convexities even in otherwise convex landscapes, potentially delaying convergence in convex problems but enhancing exploration for non-convex problems. This analysis lays the groundwork for future advancements by highlighting: 1) the potential of neural TO for non-convex problems and dedicated GPU hardware (the"good"), 2) the limitations in smooth landscapes (the"bad"), and 3) the complex challenge of selecting optimal NN architectures and hyperparameters for superior performance (the"ugly").">

Inference in this latent space amounts to standard Kalman filtering and smoothing. We realize these operations using parallel associative scanning, similar to Mamba, to obtain a principled, highly efficient, and scalable probabilistic SSM.

        <tr id="Autonomous systems face the intricate challenge of navigating unpredictable environments and interacting with external objects. The successful integration of robotic agents into real-world situations hinges on their perception capabilities, which involve amalgamating world models and predictive skills. Effective perception models build upon the fusion of various sensory modalities to probe the surroundings. Deep learning applied to raw sensory modalities offers a viable option. However, learning-based perceptive representations become difficult to interpret. This challenge is particularly pronounced in soft robots, where the compliance of structures and materials makes prediction even harder. Our work addresses this complexity by harnessing a generative model to construct a multi-modal perception model for soft robots and to leverage proprioceptive and visual information to anticipate and interpret contact interactions with external objects. A suite of tools to interpret the perception model is furnished, shedding light on the fusion and prediction processes across multiple sensory inputs after the learning phase.

Of the plausible arrangements of atoms in a periodic lattice only a vanishingly small percentage are thermodynamically stable, which is a key indicator of the materials that can be experimentally realized. Two fundamental tasks in this area are to (a) predict the stable crystal structure of a known composition of elements and (b) propose novel compositions along with their stable structures. We present FlowMM, a pair of generative models that achieve state-of-the-art performance on both tasks while being more efficient and more flexible than competing methods. We generalize Riemannian Flow Matching to suit the symmetries inherent to crystals: translation, rotation, permutation, and periodic boundary conditions. Our framework enables the freedom to choose the flow base distributions, drastically simplifying the problem of learning crystal structures compared with diffusion models. In addition to standard benchmarks, we validate FlowMM's generated structures with quantum chemistry calculations, demonstrating that it is about 3x more efficient, in terms of integration steps, at finding stable materials compared to previous open methods.">

        <tr id="The Value Iteration Network (VIN) is an end-to-end differentiable architecture that performs value iteration on a latent MDP for planning in reinforcement learning (RL). However, VINs struggle to scale to long-term and large-scale planning tasks, such as navigating a $100\times 100$ maze -- a task which typically requires thousands of planning steps to solve. We observe that this deficiency is due to two issues: the representation capacity of the latent MDP and the planning module's depth. We address these by augmenting the latent MDP with a dynamic transition kernel, dramatically improving its representational capacity, and, to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, introducing an"adaptive highway loss"that constructs skip connections to improve gradient flow. We evaluate our method on both 2D maze navigation environments and the ViZDoom 3D navigation benchmark. We find that our new method, named Dynamic Transition VIN (DT-VIN), easily scales to 5000 layers and casually solves challenging versions of the above tasks. Altogether, we believe that DT-VIN represents a concrete step forward in performing long-term large-scale planning in RL environments.">

Effective crowd navigation requires not only safe yet fast planning, but should also enable interpretability and computational efficiency for working in real-time on embedded devices. In this work, we advocate for hyperbolic learning to enable crowd navigation and we introduce Hyp2Nav. Different from conventional reinforcement learning-based crowd navigation methods, Hyp2Nav leverages the intrinsic properties of hyperbolic geometry to better encode the hierarchical nature of decision-making processes in navigation tasks. We propose a hyperbolic policy model and a hyperbolic curiosity module that results in effective social navigation, best success rates, and returns across multiple simulation settings, using up to 6 times fewer parameters than competitor state-of-the-art models. With our approach, it becomes even possible to obtain policies that work in 2-dimensional embedding spaces, opening up new possibilities for low-resource crowd navigation and model interpretability. Insightfully, the internal hyperbolic representation of Hyp2Nav correlates with how much attention the robot pays to the surrounding crowds, e.g. due to multiple people occluding its pathway or to a few of them showing colliding plans, rather than to its own planned route.">

One way to understand the behavior of the swarm is through collective behavior reconstruction using prior demonstrations. Existing approaches often require access to the swarm controller which may not be available. We reconstruct collective behaviors in distinct swarm scenarios involving shared environments without using swarm controller information. We achieve this by transforming prior demonstrations into features that sufficiently describe multi-agent interactions before behavior reconstruction with multi-agent generative adversarial imitation learning (MA-GAIL). We show that our approach outperforms existing algorithms in all investigated swarm scenarios, and can be used to observe and reconstruct a swarm's behavior for further analysis and testing, which might be impractical or undesirable on the original robot swarm.">

In our model, a system representation is inferred from given small data using an encoder network. Then, the system-specific vector field is predicted by modeling the Hamiltonian using a Gaussian process (GP) with neural network-based mean and kernel functions that depend on the inferred system representation. This GP-based Hamiltonian allows us to analytically obtain predictions that are adapted to small data while imposing the constraint of the conservation law. The neural networks are shared across systems, which enables us to learn knowledge from multiple systems, and use it for unseen systems.

        <tr id="Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved exceptional performance across various fields by learning complex nonlinear mappings from large-scale datasets. However, they encounter challenges such as high computational costs and limited interpretability. To address these issues, hybrid approaches that integrate physics with AI are gaining interest. This paper introduces a novel physics-based AI model called the"Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Network", which treats the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NLSE) as a general-purpose trainable model for learning complex patterns including nonlinear mappings and memory effects from data. Existing physics-informed machine learning methods use neural networks to approximate the solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs). In contrast, our approach directly treats the PDE as a trainable model to obtain general nonlinear mappings that would otherwise require neural networks. As a type of physics-AI symbiosis, it offers a more interpretable and parameter-efficient alternative to traditional black-box neural networks, achieving comparable or better accuracy in some time series classification tasks while significantly reducing the number of required parameters. Notably, the trained Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Network is interpretable, with all parameters having physical meanings as properties of a virtual physical system that transforms the data to a more separable space. This interpretability allows for insight into the underlying dynamics of the data transformation process. Applications to time series forecasting have also been explored. While our current implementation utilizes the NLSE, the proposed method of using physics equations as trainable models to learn nonlinear mappings from data is not limited to the NLSE and may be extended to other master equations of physics.">

To address this issue, we propose and formulate the Physical Trajectory Residual Learning (DeltaPhi), which learns to predict the physical residuals between the pending solved trajectory and a known similar auxiliary trajectory. First, we transform the direct operator mapping between input-output function fields in original training data to residual operator mapping between input function pairs and output function residuals. Next, we learn the surrogate model for the residual operator mapping based on existing neural operator networks. Additionally, we design helpful customized auxiliary inputs for efficient optimization. Through extensive experiments, we conclude that, compared to direct learning, physical residual learning is preferred for PDE solving.">

        <tr id="Recently, Neural Fields have emerged as a powerful modelling paradigm to represent continuous signals. In a conditional neural field, a field is represented by a latent variable that conditions the NeF, whose parametrisation is otherwise shared over an entire dataset. We propose Equivariant Neural Fields based on cross attention transformers, in which NeFs are conditioned on a geometric conditioning variable, a latent point cloud, that enables an equivariant decoding from latent to field. Our equivariant approach induces a steerability property by which both field and latent are grounded in geometry and amenable to transformation laws if the field transforms, the latent represents transforms accordingly and vice versa. Crucially, the equivariance relation ensures that the latent is capable of (1) representing geometric patterns faitfhully, allowing for geometric reasoning in latent space, (2) weightsharing over spatially similar patterns, allowing for efficient learning of datasets of fields. These main properties are validated using classification experiments and a verification of the capability of fitting entire datasets, in comparison to other non-equivariant NeF approaches. We further validate the potential of ENFs by demonstrate unique local field editing properties.">

        <tr id="In order to accurately model the dynamics of non-linear electro-mechanical systems, it is imperative to consider the contributions of coupling terms and dissipation. The Lagrangian formulation alone is insufficient to fully capture the holistic behavior of the system. Coupling and dissipation mechanisms play a pivotal role in shaping the system's response. Consequently, to effectively capture the dynamics of inter-coupled electro-mechanical systems with dissipation, we propose an extended Lagrangian-informed deep neural network framework in this paper. Our approach leverages the underlying physics-based knowledge of the system, incorporating it into the neural network architecture. By employing the Euler-Lagrange equations as constraints in the training process, we ensure that the learned dynamics conform to the true behavior of the system. To validate the theoretical framework, we conduct simulation experiments on a DC motor with a cart system, which serves as a representative model of dissipative nonlinear electro-mechanical systems. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in accurately capturing and integrating the dynamics to solve the reference tracking model predictive control design.">

Traditional top-down methods, relying on whole-body parametric models like SMPL, falter when only a small part of the human is visible, as they require visibility of most of the human body for accurate mesh reconstruction. To overcome this limitation, our method employs a"Divide and Fuse (D&F)"strategy, reconstructing human body parts independently before fusing them, thereby ensuring robustness against occlusions. We design Human Part Parametric Models (HPPM) that independently reconstruct the mesh from a few shape and global-location parameters, without inter-part dependency. A specially designed fusion module then seamlessly integrates the reconstructed parts, even when only a few are visible. We harness a large volume of ground-truth SMPL data to train our parametric mesh models. To facilitate the training and evaluation of our method, we have established benchmark datasets featuring images of partially visible humans with HPPM annotations. Our experiments, conducted on these benchmark datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our D&F method, particularly in scenarios with substantial invisibility, where traditional approaches struggle to maintain reconstruction quality.">

However, building a surrogate model with high accuracy and fast inference speed can be challenging for soft robotics due to the nonlinearity from complex geometry, large deformation, material nonlinearity etc. The reality gap from surrogate models also prevents their further deployment in the soft robotics domain. In this study, we proposed a physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) named PINN-Ray to model complex deformation for a Fin Ray soft robotic gripper, which embeds the minimum potential energy principle from elastic mechanics and additional high-fidelity experimental data into the loss function of neural network for training. This method is significant in terms of its generalisation to complex geometry and robust to data scarcity as compared to other data-driven neural networks. Furthermore, it has been extensively evaluated to model the deformation of the Fin Ray finger under external actuation. PINN-Ray demonstrates improved accuracy as compared with Finite element modelling (FEM) after applying the data assimilation scheme to treat the sim-to-real gap. Additionally, we introduced our automated framework to design, fabricate soft robotic fingers, and characterise their deformation by visual tracking, which provides a guideline for the fast prototype of soft robotics.">

Although they have demonstrated powerful fitting and predicting, most existing models are only built to learn single-system dynamics. Several advanced researches have considered learning dynamics across environments, which can exploit the potential commonalities among the dynamics across environments and adapt to new environments. However, these methods still are prone to scarcity problems where per-environment data is sparse or limited. Therefore, we propose a novel CoNDP (Context-Informed Neural ODE Processes) to achieve learning system dynamics from sparse observations across environments. It can fully use contextual information of each environment to better capture the intrinsic commonalities across environments and distinguishable differences among environments while modeling uncertainty of system evolution, producing more accurate predictions. Intensive experiments are conducted on five complex dynamical systems in various fields.

Statistical shape modeling (SSM) is a widely used tool for quantitative analysis of forms of anatomies, aiding in characterizing and identifying differences within a population of subjects. Despite its utility, the conventional SSM construction pipeline is often complex and time-consuming. Additionally, reliance on linearity assumptions further limits the model from capturing clinically relevant variations. Recent advancements in deep learning solutions enable the direct inference of SSM from unsegmented medical images, streamlining the process and improving accessibility. However, the new methods of SSM from images do not adequately account for situations where the imaging data quality is poor or where only sparse information is available. Moreover, quantifying aleatoric uncertainty, which represents inherent data variability, is crucial in deploying deep learning for clinical tasks to ensure reliable model predictions and robust decision-making, especially in challenging imaging conditions. Therefore, we propose SPI-CorrNet, a unified model that predicts 3D correspondences from sparse imaging data. It leverages a teacher network to regularize feature learning and quantifies data-dependent aleatoric uncertainty by adapting the network to predict intrinsic input variances.

Unfortunately, the online evaluation of these functions is restricted due to time and safety constraints in most cases. In offline model-based optimization (MBO), we aim to find a design that maximizes the target function using only a pre-existing offline dataset. While prior methods consider forward or inverse approaches to address the problem, these approaches are limited by conservatism and the difficulty of learning highly multi-modal mappings. Recently, there has been an emerging paradigm of learning to improve solutions with synthetic trajectories constructed from the offline dataset. In this paper, we introduce a novel conditional generative modeling approach to produce trajectories toward high-scoring regions. First, we construct synthetic trajectories toward high-scoring regions using the dataset while injecting locality bias for consistent improvement directions. Then, we train a conditional diffusion model to generate trajectories conditioned on their scores. Lastly, we sample multiple trajectories from the trained model with guidance to explore high-scoring regions beyond the dataset and select high-fidelity designs among generated trajectories with the proxy function. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms competitive baselines on Design-Bench and its practical variants.

The study of these control mechanisms will provide insights into the control of high-dimensional, overactuated systems. The coordination of actuators, known as muscle synergies in neuromechanics, is considered a presumptive mechanism that simplifies the generation of motor commands. The dynamical structure of a system is the basis of its function, allowing us to derive a synergistic representation of actuators. Motivated by this theory, we propose the Dynamical Synergistic Representation (DynSyn) algorithm. DynSyn aims to generate synergistic representations from dynamical structures and perform task-specific, state-dependent adaptation to the representations to improve motor control. We demonstrate DynSyn's efficiency across various tasks involving different musculoskeletal models, achieving state-of-the-art sample efficiency and robustness compared to baseline algorithms. DynSyn generates interpretable synergistic representations that capture the essential features of dynamical structures and demonstrates generalizability across diverse motor tasks.">

In this work, we propose WoCoCo (Whole-Body Control with Sequential Contacts), a unified framework to learn whole-body humanoid control with sequential contacts by naturally decomposing the tasks into separate contact stages. Such decomposition facilitates simple and general policy learning pipelines through task-agnostic reward and sim-to-real designs, requiring only one or two task-related terms to be specified for each task. We demonstrated that end-to-end RL-based controllers trained with WoCoCo enable four challenging whole-body humanoid tasks involving diverse contact sequences in the real world without any motion priors: 1) versatile parkour jumping, 2) box loco-manipulation, 3) dynamic clap-and-tap dancing, and 4) cliffside climbing. We further show that WoCoCo is a general framework beyond humanoid by applying it in 22-DoF dinosaur robot loco-manipulation tasks.">

Accurate modeling of these interactions is important to optimize driving performance, but the relevant physical phenomena are too complex to model from first principles. Therefore, we present an offline meta-learning algorithm to construct a rapidly-tunable model of residual dynamics and disturbances. Our model processes terrain images into features using a visual foundation model (VFM), then maps these features and the vehicle state to an estimate of the current actuation matrix using a deep neural network (DNN). We then combine this model with composite adaptive control to modify the last layer of the DNN in real time, accounting for the remaining terrain interactions not captured during offline training. We provide mathematical guarantees of stability and robustness for our controller and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulations and hardware experiments with a tracked vehicle and a car-like robot. We evaluate our method outdoors on different slopes with varying slippage and actuator degradation disturbances, and compare against an adaptive controller that does not use the VFM terrain features.

        <tr id="Diffusion models have been demonstrated as strong priors for solving general inverse problems. Most existing Diffusion model-based Inverse Problem Solvers (DIS) employ a plug-and-play approach to guide the sampling trajectory with either projections or gradients. Though effective, these methods generally necessitate hundreds of sampling steps, posing a dilemma between inference time and reconstruction quality. In this work, we try to push the boundary of inference steps to 1-2 NFEs while still maintaining high reconstruction quality. To achieve this, we propose to leverage a pretrained distillation of diffusion model, namely consistency model, as the data prior. The key to achieving few-step guidance is to enforce two types of constraints during the sampling process of the consistency model: soft measurement constraint with ControlNet and hard measurement constraint via optimization. Supporting both single-step reconstruction and multistep refinement, the proposed framework further provides a way to trade image quality with additional computational cost. Within comparable NFEs, our method achieves new state-of-the-art in diffusion-based inverse problem solving, showcasing the significant potential of employing prior-based inverse problem solvers for real-world applications.

In these experiments, the incorporation of a Boundary Connectivity (BCXN) loss function was shown to greatly improve physics-informed learning across many problems, especially those with complex geometries. However, this imposition may not always be ideal, as the previously presented BCXN-loss strongly enforces a linear local structure at the boundary. While this assumption helps facilitate faster learning with an order of magnitude sparser training samples, this can adversely impact convergence in other situations. Hence, we propose a modification of this BCXN-loss that reduces the imposed structure to a soft constraint, allowing for more flexible learning and convergence. We further demonstrate the potential for this method to improve the convergence and performance of LSA-PINN across additional numerical experiments, with much smaller errors than existing methods in terms of the standard L2-norm metric. In particular, we have applied this method to the modelling of flow past complex geometries such as airfoils, which serve as the basic building block for various applications in fluid dynamics and renewable energy (e.g., in wind and tidal turbine design).">

        <tr id="Uncertainty-aware controllers that guarantee safety are critical for safety critical applications. Among such controllers, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) based approaches are popular because they are fast, yet safe. However, most such works depend on Gaussian Processes (GPs) or MC-Dropout for learning and uncertainty estimation, and both approaches come with drawbacks: GPs are non-parametric methods that are slow, while MC-Dropout does not capture aleatoric uncertainty. On the other hand, modern Bayesian learning algorithms have shown promise in uncertainty quantification. The application of modern Bayesian learning methods to CBF-based controllers has not yet been studied. We aim to fill this gap by surveying uncertainty quantification algorithms and evaluating them on CBF-based safe controllers. We find that model variance-based algorithms (for example, Deep ensembles, MC-dropout, etc.) and direct estimation-based algorithms (such as DEUP) have complementary strengths. Algorithms in the former category can only estimate uncertainty accurately out-of-domain, while those in the latter category can only do so in-domain. We combine the two approaches to obtain more accurate uncertainty estimates both in- and out-of-domain. As measured by the failure rate of a simulated robot, this results in a safer CBF-based robot controller.">

Due to the complexity in many-electron wavefunctions, machine learning models capable of capturing fundamental many-body physics remain limited.

By learning the $GW$ or coupled-cluster self-energy from mean-field features, our graph neural network achieves competitive performance in predicting one- and two-particle excitations and quantities derivable from one-particle density matrix.

        <tr id="In dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) we seek to infer from time series measurements a generative model of the underlying dynamical process. This is a prime objective in any scientific discipline, where we are particularly interested in parsimonious models with a low parameter load. A common strategy here is parameter pruning, removing all parameters with small weights. However, here we find this strategy does not work for DSR, where even low magnitude parameters can contribute considerably to the system dynamics. On the other hand, it is well known that many natural systems which generate complex dynamics, like the brain or ecological networks, have a sparse topology with comparatively few links. Inspired by this, we show that geometric pruning, where in contrast to magnitude-based pruning weights with a low contribution to an attractor's geometrical structure are removed, indeed manages to reduce parameter load substantially without significantly hampering DSR quality. We further find that the networks resulting from geometric pruning have a specific type of topology, and that this topology, and not the magnitude of weights, is what is most crucial to performance. We provide an algorithm that automatically generates such topologies which can be used as priors for generative modeling of dynamical systems by RNNs, and compare it to other well studied topologies like small-world or scale-free networks.">

This new task requires an intricate integration of control and generation to realistically synthesize crowd dynamics under specific spatial and semantic constraints, whose challenges are yet to be fully explored. On the one hand, existing human motion generation models typically focus on individual behaviors, neglecting the complexities of collective behaviors. On the other hand, recent methods for multi-person motion generation depend heavily on pre-defined scenarios and are limited to a fixed, small number of inter-person interactions, thus hampering their practicality. To overcome these challenges, we introduce CrowdMoGen, a zero-shot text-driven framework that harnesses the power of Large Language Model (LLM) to incorporate the collective intelligence into the motion generation framework as guidance, thereby enabling generalizable planning and generation of crowd motions without paired training data. Our framework consists of two key components: 1) Crowd Scene Planner that learns to coordinate motions and dynamics according to specific scene contexts or introduced perturbations, and 2) Collective Motion Generator that efficiently synthesizes the required collective motions based on the holistic plans. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments have validated the effectiveness of our framework, which not only fills a critical gap by providing scalable and generalizable solutions for Crowd Motion Generation task but also achieves high levels of realism and flexibility.">

This paper introduces an advanced physics-informed DeepONet tailored for such complex systems with multiple input functions. Equipped with architectural enhancements like nonlinear decoders and effective training strategies such as curriculum learning and domain decomposition, the proposed model handles high-dimensional design spaces with significantly improved accuracy, outperforming the vanilla physics-informed DeepONet by two orders of magnitude.

However, as both the input and output streams of these models consist of low-level shape representations, they often fail to capture shape characteristics essential for performance analyses. Therefore, the proposed GOs exploit the differential and integral properties of shapes--accessed through Fourier descriptors, curvature integrals, geometric moments, and their invariants--to infuse high-level intrinsic geometric information and physics into the feature vector used for training, even when employing simple model architectures or low-level parametric descriptions. We showed that for surrogate modelling, along with the inclusion of the notion of physics, GOs enact regularisation to reduce over-fitting and enhance generalisation to new, unseen designs. Furthermore, through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that for dimension reduction and generative models, incorporating the proposed GOs enriches the training data with compact global and local geometric features. This significantly enhances the quality of the resulting latent space, thereby facilitating the generation of valid and diverse designs. Lastly, we also show that GOs can enable learning parametric sensitivities to a great extent. Consequently, these enhancements accelerate the convergence rate of shape optimisers towards optimal solutions.">

In particular, the discovery of new inorganic materials with promising properties poses a critical challenge, both scientifically and for industrial applications. However, unlike textual or image data, materials, or more specifically crystal structures, consist of multiple types of variables - including lattice vectors, atom positions, and atomic species. This complexity in data give rise to a variety of approaches for representing and generating such data. Consequently, the design choices of generative models for crystal structures remain an open question. In this study, we explore a new type of diffusion model for the generative inverse design of crystal structures, with a backbone based on a Transformer architecture. We demonstrate our models are superior to previous methods in their versatility for generating crystal structures with desired properties.

In this paper, we introduce a zero-shot, open-vocabulary diffusion policy method for robot manipulation. Using Vision-Language Models (VLMs), our method transforms linguistic task descriptions into actionable keyframes in 3D space. These keyframes serve to guide the diffusion process via inpainting. However, naively enforcing the diffusion process to adhere to the generated keyframes is problematic: the keyframes from the VLMs may be incorrect and lead to out-of-distribution (OOD) action sequences where the diffusion model performs poorly. To address these challenges, we develop an inpainting optimization strategy that balances adherence to the keyframes v.s. the training data distribution. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach surpasses the performance of traditional fine-tuned language-conditioned methods in both simulated and real-world settings.">

However, in this perspective, we argue that a more successful approach is a proper combination of these two methodologies. We discuss how ideas coming from physical modeling neuronal processing led to early formulations of computational neural networks, e.g., Hopfield networks. We then show how modern learning approaches like Potts models, Boltzmann machines, and the transformer architecture are related to each other, specifically, through a shared energy representation. We summarize recent efforts to establish these connections and provide examples on how each of these formulations integrating physical modeling and machine learning have been successful in tackling recent problems in biomolecular structure, dynamics, function, evolution, and design. Instances include protein structure prediction; improvement in computational complexity and accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations; better inference of the effects of mutations in proteins leading to improved evolutionary modeling and finally how machine learning is revolutionizing protein engineering and design. Going beyond naturally existing protein sequences, a connection to protein design is discussed where synthetic sequences are able to fold to naturally occurring motifs driven by a model rooted in physical principles. We show that this model is “learnable” and propose its future use in the generation of unique sequences that can fold into a target structure.">

Combined with a scaling law curve like Chinchilla, this lets us estimate the final loss of the model. We fit our estimate to real data with a linear regression, and apply the result to rewrite Chinchilla in terms of a model's estimated training time as opposed to the amount of training data. This gives an expression for the loss in terms of the model's hyperparameters alone.

However, enforcing inequality constraints in real time for such high-dimensional systems remains challenging due to the need for additional iterations. This paper presents an implementation of whole-body NMPC for legged robots that provides low-accuracy solutions to NMPC with general equality and inequality constraints. Instead of aiming for highly accurate optimal solutions, we leverage the alternating direction method of multipliers to rapidly provide low-accuracy solutions to quadratic programming subproblems. Our extensive simulation results indicate that real robots often cannot benefit from highly accurate solutions due to dynamics discretization errors, inertial modeling errors and delays. We incorporate control barrier functions (CBFs) at the initial timestep of the NMPC for the self-collision constraints, resulting in up to a 26-fold reduction in the number of self-collisions without adding computational burden. The controller is reliably deployed on hardware at 90 Hz for a problem involving 32 timesteps, 2004 variables, and 3768 constraints.

In this work, we propose an alternative scheme for training CMs, vastly improving the efficiency of building such models. Specifically, by expressing CM trajectories via a particular differential equation, we argue that diffusion models can be viewed as a special case of CMs with a specific discretization. We can thus fine-tune a consistency model starting from a pre-trained diffusion model and progressively approximate the full consistency condition to stronger degrees over the training process. Our resulting method, which we term Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT), achieves vastly improved training times while indeed improving upon the quality of previous methods: for example, ECT achieves a 2-step FID of 2.73 on CIFAR10 within 1 hour on a single A100 GPU, matching Consistency Distillation trained of hundreds of GPU hours. Owing to this computational efficiency, we investigate the scaling law of CMs under ECT, showing that they seem to obey classic power law scaling, hinting at their ability to improve efficiency and performance at larger scales.

        <tr id="One of the core concepts in science, and something that happens intuitively in every-day dynamic systems modeling, is the combination of models or methods. Especially in dynamical systems modeling, often two or more structures are combined to obtain a more powerful or efficient architecture regarding a specific application (area). Further, even physical simulations are combined with machine learning architectures, to increase prediction accuracy or optimize the computational performance. In this work, we shortly discuss, which types of models are usually combined and propose a model interface that is capable of expressing a width variety of mixed algebraic, discrete and differential equation based models. Further, we examine different established, as well as new ways of combining these models from a system theoretical point of view and highlight two challenges - algebraic loops and local event affect functions in discontinuous models - that require a special approach. Finally, we propose a new wildcard topology, that is capable of describing the generic connection between two combined models in an easy to interpret fashion that can be learned as part of a gradient based optimization procedure. The contributions of this paper are highlighted at a proof of concept: Different connection topologies between two models are learned, interpreted and compared applying the proposed methodology and software implementation.">

Due to the properties of flexible materials, the movements of soft objects are often highly nonlinear and, thus, complex to predict. Data-driven approaches seem promising for modeling those complex dynamics but often neglect basic physical principles, which consequently makes them untrustworthy and limits generalization. To address this problem, we propose a physics-constrained learning method that combines powerful learning tools and reliable physical models. Our method leverages the data collected from observations by sending them into a Gaussian process that is physically constrained by a distributed Port-Hamiltonian model. Based on the Bayesian nature of the Gaussian process, we not only learn the dynamics of the system, but also enable uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, the proposed approach preserves the compositional nature of Port-Hamiltonian systems.">

Physics-informed DeepONets (PI-DeepONet) mitigate data scarcity but suffer from inefficient training processes. We introduce Separable Operator Networks (SepONet), a novel framework that significantly enhances the efficiency of physics-informed operator learning. SepONet uses independent trunk networks to learn basis functions separately for different coordinate axes, enabling faster and more memory-efficient training via forward-mode automatic differentiation. We provide theoretical guarantees for SepONet using the universal approximation theorem and validate its performance through comprehensive benchmarking against PI-DeepONet. Our results demonstrate that for the 1D time-dependent advection equation, when targeting a mean relative $\ell_{2}$ error of less than 6% on 100 unseen variable coefficients, SepONet provides up to $112 \times$ training speed-up and $82 \times$ GPU memory usage reduction compared to PI-DeepONet. Similar computational advantages are observed across various partial differential equations, with SepONet's efficiency gains scaling favorably as problem complexity increases.

In this work, we introduce the Catalyst Generative Pretrained Transformer (CatGPT), trained to generate string representations of inorganic catalyst structures from a vast chemical space. CatGPT not only demonstrates high performance in generating valid and accurate catalyst structures but also serves as a foundation model for generating desired types of catalysts by fine-tuning with sparse and specified datasets.

However, these methods often fall short when applied to actual physical models due to imperfections in the manufacturing of structural elements, assembly errors, and material non-linearities. In this work, we develop a deep neural network (DNN) approach to predict the geometric configurations and physical properties-such as nodal coordinates, member forces, and natural frequencies-of any tensegrity structures in equilibrium states. First, we outline the analytical governing equations for tensegrity structures, covering statics involving nodal coordinates and member forces, as well as modal information. Next, we propose a data-driven framework for training an appropriate DNN model capable of simultaneously predicting tensegrity forms and physical properties, thereby circumventing the need to solve equilibrium equations. For validation, we analyze three tensegrity structures, including a tensegrity D-bar, prism, and lander, demonstrating that our approach can identify approximation systems with relatively very small output errors. This technique is applicable to a wide range of tensegrity structures, particularly in real-world construction, and can be extended to address additional challenges in identifying structural physics information.">

Typically, the properties of a polymer, such as plasticity, conductivity, bio-compatibility, and so on, are highly correlated with its 3D structure. However, existing polymer property prediction methods heavily rely on the information learned from polymer SMILES sequences (P-SMILES strings) while ignoring crucial 3D structural information, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this work, we propose MMPolymer, a novel multimodal multitask pretraining framework incorporating polymer 1D sequential and 3D structural information to encourage downstream polymer property prediction tasks. Besides, considering the scarcity of polymer 3D data, we further introduce the"Star Substitution"strategy to extract 3D structural information effectively. During pretraining, in addition to predicting masked tokens and recovering clear 3D coordinates, MMPolymer achieves the cross-modal alignment of latent representations. Then we further fine-tune the pretrained MMPolymer for downstream polymer property prediction tasks in the supervised learning paradigm. Experiments show that MMPolymer achieves state-of-the-art performance in downstream property prediction tasks. Moreover, given the pretrained MMPolymer, utilizing merely a single modality in the fine-tuning phase can also outperform existing methods, showcasing the exceptional capability of MMPolymer in polymer feature extraction and utilization.">

In the absence of labeled datasets, we utilize the PDE residual loss to learn the physical system, an approach known as physics-informed DeepONet. This method faces significant computational challenges, primarily due to the curse of dimensionality, as the computational cost increases exponentially with finer discretization. In this paper, we introduce the Separable DeepONet framework to address these challenges and improve scalability for high-dimensional PDEs. Our approach involves a factorization technique where sub-networks handle individual one-dimensional coordinates, thereby reducing the number of forward passes and the size of the Jacobian matrix. By using forward-mode automatic differentiation, we further optimize the computational cost related to the Jacobian matrix. As a result, our modifications lead to a linear scaling of computational cost with discretization density, making Separable DeepONet suitable for high-dimensional PDEs. We validate the effectiveness of the separable architecture through three benchmark PDE models: the viscous Burgers equation, Biot's consolidation theory, and a parametrized heat equation. In all cases, our proposed framework achieves comparable or improved accuracy while significantly reducing computational time compared to conventional DeepONet.

These processes find wide application in the natural sciences and machine learning, but their inference is known to be far from trivial. In this work we introduce a methodology for zero-shot inference of Markov jump processes (MJPs), on bounded state spaces, from noisy and sparse observations, which consists of two components. First, a broad probability distribution over families of MJPs, as well as over possible observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we simulate a synthetic dataset of hidden MJPs and their noisy observation process. Second, a neural network model that processes subsets of the simulated observations, and that is trained to output the initial condition and rate matrix of the target MJP in a supervised way. We empirically demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) model can infer, in a zero-shot fashion, hidden MJPs evolving in state spaces of different dimensionalities. Specifically, we infer MJPs which describe (i) discrete flashing ratchet systems, which are a type of Brownian motors, and the conformational dynamics in (ii) molecular simulations, (iii) experimental ion channel data and (iv) simple protein folding models. What is more, we show that our model performs on par with state-of-the-art models which are finetuned to the target datasets.">

Here we show that Deep AndersoNN achieves up to an order of magnitude of speed-up in training and inference. The method is demonstrated on density functional theory results for industrial applications by constructing artificial life and materials `scientists' capable of classifying drugs as strongly or weakly polar, metal-organic frameworks by pore size, and crystalline materials as metals, semiconductors, and insulators, using graph images of node-neighbor representations transformed from atom-bond networks. Results exhibit accuracy up to 98\% and showcase synergy between Deep AndersoNN and machine learning capabilities of modern computing architectures, such as GPUs, for accelerated computational life and materials science by quickly identifying structure-property relationships.

        <tr id="A central question in deep learning is how deep neural networks (DNNs) learn features. DNN layers progressively collapse data into a regular low-dimensional geometry. This collective effect of non-linearity, noise, learning rate, width, depth, and numerous other parameters, has eluded first-principles theories which are built from microscopic neuronal dynamics. Here we present a noise-non-linearity phase diagram that highlights where shallow or deep layers learn features more effectively. We then propose a macroscopic mechanical theory of feature learning that accurately reproduces this phase diagram, offering a clear intuition for why and how some DNNs are ``lazy'' and some are ``active'', and relating the distribution of feature learning over layers with test accuracy.">

Neural operators are deep neural networks designed to learn nontrivial solution operators of such differential equations from data. As for all statistical models, the predictions of these models are imperfect and exhibit errors. Such errors are particularly difficult to spot in the complex nonlinear behaviour of dynamical systems. We introduce a new framework for approximate Bayesian uncertainty quantification in neural operators using function-valued Gaussian processes. Our approach can be interpreted as a probabilistic analogue of the concept of currying from functional programming and provides a practical yet theoretically sound way to apply the linearized Laplace approximation to neural operators. In a case study on Fourier neural operators, we show that, even for a discretized input, our method yields a Gaussian closure--a structured Gaussian process posterior capturing the uncertainty in the output function of the neural operator, which can be evaluated at an arbitrary set of points. The method adds minimal prediction overhead, can be applied post-hoc without retraining the neural operator, and scales to large models and datasets. We showcase the efficacy of our approach through applications to different types of partial differential equations.">

Parameterization is useful for data assimilation (history matching), as it maintains geological realism while reducing the number of variables to be determined. Diffusion models are a new class of generative deep-learning procedures that have been shown to outperform previous methods, such as generative adversarial networks, for image generation tasks. Diffusion models are trained to"denoise", which enables them to generate new geological realizations from input fields characterized by random noise. Latent diffusion models, which are the specific variant considered in this study, provide dimension reduction through use of a low-dimensional latent variable. The model developed in this work includes a variational autoencoder for dimension reduction and a U-net for the denoising process. Our application involves conditional 2D three-facies (channel-levee-mud) systems. The latent diffusion model is shown to provide realizations that are visually consistent with samples from geomodeling software. Quantitative metrics involving spatial and flow-response statistics are evaluated, and general agreement between the diffusion-generated models and reference realizations is observed. Stability tests are performed to assess the smoothness of the parameterization method. The latent diffusion model is then used for ensemble-based data assimilation. Two synthetic"true"models are considered. Significant uncertainty reduction, posterior P$_{10}$-P$_{90}$ forecasts that generally bracket observed data, and consistent posterior geomodels, are achieved in both cases.">

JKOnet* minimizes a simple quadratic loss, runs at lightspeed, and drastically outperforms other baselines in practice. Additionally, JKOnet* provides a closed-form optimal solution for linearly parametrized functionals.

While training is cheap, samples are generated via simulation, which is more expensive than one-step models like GANs. To close this gap, we introduce flow map matching -- an algorithm that learns the two-time flow map of an underlying ordinary differential equation. The approach leads to an efficient few-step generative model whose step count can be chosen a-posteriori to smoothly trade off accuracy for computational expense. Leveraging the stochastic interpolant framework, we introduce losses for both direct training of flow maps and distillation from pre-trained (or otherwise known) velocity fields. Theoretically, we show that our approach unifies many existing few-step generative models, including consistency models, consistency trajectory models, progressive distillation, and neural operator approaches, which can be obtained as particular cases of our formalism. With experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 32x32, we show that flow map matching leads to high-quality samples with significantly reduced sampling cost compared to diffusion or stochastic interpolant methods.">

PICs are symbolic computational graphs defining continuous LV models as hierarchies of functions that are summed and multiplied together, or integrated over some LVs. They are tractable if LVs can be analytically integrated out, otherwise they can be approximated by tractable probabilistic circuits (PC) encoding a hierarchical numerical quadrature process, called QPCs. So far, only tree-shaped PICs have been explored, and training them via numerical quadrature requires memory-intensive processing at scale. In this paper, we address these issues, and present: (i) a pipeline for building DAG-shaped PICs out of arbitrary variable decompositions, (ii) a procedure for training PICs using tensorized circuit architectures, and (iii) neural functional sharing techniques to allow scalable training. In extensive experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of functional sharing and the superiority of QPCs over traditional PCs.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promising potential for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using deep learning. 

However, PINNs face training difficulties for evolutionary PDEs, particularly for dynamical systems whose solutions exhibit multi-scale or turbulent behavior over time.

The reason is that PINNs may violate the temporal causality property since all the temporal features in the PINNs loss are trained simultaneously. 

This paper proposes to use implicit time differencing schemes to enforce temporal causality, and use transfer learning to sequentially update the PINNs in space as surrogates for PDE solutions in different time frames.

The evolving PINNs are better able to capture the varying complexities of the evolutionary equations, while only requiring minor updates between adjacent time frames.

Our method is theoretically proven to be convergent if the time step is small and each PINN in different time frames is well-trained.

In addition, we provide state-of-the-art (SOTA) numerical results for a variety of benchmarks for which existing PINNs formulations may fail or be inefficient.

We demonstrate that the proposed method improves the accuracy of PINNs approximation for evolutionary PDEs and improves efficiency by a factor of 4–40x.

However, training AI models for target recognition typically requires large amounts of data with thousands of labeled examples. Labeling is expensive and, more importantly, in some cases sufficient examples do not exist to create an AI detection model, suggesting a need of synthetic data. We investigated multiple configurations for model training, including using various mixes of real and synthetic data, domain adaptation, and fine tuning of models. Creation of the best synthetic data via physics based simulation methods proved to be time consuming and still left a domain gap between synthetic and real data. Attempts to bridge this gap with domain adaptation suffered from model induced artifacts and still required fine-tuning with some real data to yield an improvement. While AI generated data provides less realism, it can be effective for creating a closed loop system between data generation and model development. Our results show that it is usually possible to use synthetic data to improve the performance of AI models compared to those trained solely on real data. However, the performance improvement for adding additional real data is significantly higher than for adding a similar number of synthetically generated samples.">

ECM directly injects guidance gradients to the estimated clean manifold, eliminating extensive gradient backpropagation throughout the network. Our methodology streamlines the generative process, enabling practical applications with reduced computational overhead.

        <tr id="Abstract. Climate models are hindered by the need to conceptualize and then parameterize complex physical processes that are not explicitly numerically resolved and for which no rigorous theory exists. Machine learning and artificial intelligence methods (ML and AI) offer a promising paradigm that can augment or replace the traditional parameterized approach with models trained on empirical process data. We offer a flexible and efficient plugin, TorchClim, that facilitates the insertion of ML and AI physics surrogates into the climate model to create hybrid models. A reference implementation is presented for the Community Earth System Model (CESM), where moist physics and radiation parameterizations of the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM) are replaced with such a surrogate. We present a set of best-practice principles for doing this with minimal changes to the general circulation model (GCM), exposing the surrogate model as any other parameterization module, and discuss how to accommodate the requirements of physics surrogates such as the need to avoid unphysical values and supply information needed by other GCM components. We show that a deep-neural-network surrogate trained on data from CAM itself can produce a model that reproduces the climate and variability in the original model, although with some biases. The efficiency and flexibility of this approach open up new possibilities for using physics surrogates trained on offline data to improve climate model performance, better understand model physical processes, and flexibly incorporate new processes into climate models.

In this paper we leverage the universal approximation properties of neural networks (NNs) to develop neural DeePC algorithms for nonlinear systems. Firstly, we point out that the outputs of the last hidden layer of a deep NN implicitly construct a basis in a so-called neural (feature) space, while the output linear layer performs affine interpolation in the neural space. As such, we can train off-line a deep NN using large data sets of trajectories to learn the neural basis and compute on-line a suitable affine interpolation using DeePC. Secondly, methods for guaranteeing consistency of neural DeePC and for reducing computational complexity are developed. Several neural DeePC formulations are illustrated on a nonlinear pendulum example.">

However, many of the tools for identifying these low-dimensional subspaces are correlational and provide limited insight into the underlying dynamics. The ability to precisely control this latent activity would allow researchers to investigate the structure and function of neural manifolds. Employing techniques from the field of optimal control, we simulate controlling the latent dynamics of a neural population using closed-loop, dynamically generated sensory inputs. Using a spiking neural network (SNN) as a model of a neural circuit, we find low-dimensional representations of both the network activity (the neural manifold) and a set of salient visual stimuli. With a data-driven latent dynamics model, we apply model predictive control (MPC) to provide anticipatory, optimal control over the trajectory of the circuit in a latent space. We are able to control the latent dynamics of the SNN to follow several reference trajectories despite observing only a subset of neurons and with a substantial amount of unknown noise injected into the network. These results provide a framework to experimentally test for causal relationships between manifold dynamics and other variables of interest such as organismal behavior and BCI performance.">

However, these methods often encounter challenges when dealing with problems involving complex geometries. Machine learning-based methods, on the other hand, are mesh-free, thus providing a promising alternative. In particular, operator learning methods have been proposed to learn the mapping from the input space to the solution space, enabling rapid inference of solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) once trained. In this work, we address the parametric elliptic interface problem. Building upon the deep operator network (DeepONet), we propose an extended interface deep operator network (XI-DeepONet). XI-DeepONet exhibits three unique features: (1) The interface geometry is incorporated into the neural network as an additional input, enabling the network to infer solutions for new interface geometries once trained; (2) The level set function associated with the interface geometry is treated as the input, on which the solution mapping is continuous and can be effectively approximated by the deep operator network; (3) The network can be trained without any input-output data pairs, thus completely avoiding the need for meshes of any kind, directly or indirectly. We conduct a comprehensive series of numerical experiments to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method.">

Classic solvers for this task continue to play a central role, e.g. to generate training data for deep learning analogues. Any such numerical solution is subject to multiple sources of uncertainty, both from limited computational resources and limited data (including unknown parameters). Gaussian process analogues to classic PDE simulation methods have recently emerged as a framework to construct fully probabilistic estimates of all these types of uncertainty. So far, much of this work focused on theoretical foundations, and as such is not particularly data efficient or scalable. Here we propose a framework combining a discretization scheme based on the popular Finite Volume Method with complementary numerical linear algebra techniques. Practical experiments, including a spatiotemporal tsunami simulation, demonstrate substantially improved scaling behavior of this approach over previous collocation-based techniques.">

        <tr id="In the pursuit of developing expressive music performance models using artificial intelligence, this paper introduces DExter, a new approach leveraging diffusion probabilistic models to render Western classical piano performances. The main challenge faced in performance rendering tasks is the continuous and sequential modeling of expressive timing and dynamics over time, which is critical for capturing the evolving nuances that characterize live musical performances. In this approach, performance parameters are represented in a continuous expression space, and a diffusion model is trained to predict these continuous parameters while being conditioned on a musical score. Furthermore, DExter also enables the generation of interpretations (expressive variations of a performance) guided by perceptually meaningful features by being jointly conditioned on score and perceptual-feature representations. Consequently, we find that our model is useful for learning expressive performance, generating perceptually steered performances, and transferring performance styles. We assess the model through quantitative and qualitative analyses, focusing on specific performance metrics regarding dimensions like asynchrony and articulation, as well as through listening tests that compare generated performances with different human interpretations. The results show that DExter is able to capture the time-varying correlation of the expressive parameters, and it compares well to existing rendering models in subjectively evaluated ratings. The perceptual-feature-conditioned generation and transferring capabilities of DExter are verified via a proxy model predicting perceptual characteristics of differently steered performances.">

A sampling-based approach, ASKU, performing reachability analysis for the DIKU is developed to approximate the TIS of nonlinear control systems online. Furthermore, we design an online time-informed SKMP using a direct sampling technique to draw uniform random samples in the TIS.

We present a solution for the first issue using a data-driven surrogate model in the form of a convolutional Long-Short Term Memory network with actuation. We demonstrate that learning an actuated model in parallel to training the RL agent significantly reduces the total amount of required data sampled from the real system.

To this end, the hyperelastic material models are integrated into the loss function of the NIM method by employing a consistent local variational formulation. Thanks to the inherent differentiable programming capabilities, NIM can circumvent the need for derivation of Newton-Raphson linearization of the variational form and the resulting tangent stiffness matrix, typically required in traditional numerical methods. Additionally, NIM utilizes a hybrid neural-numerical approximation encoded with partition-of-unity basis functions, coined NeuroPU, to effectively represent the displacement and streamline the training process. NeuroPU can also be used for approximating the unknown material fields, enabling NIM a unified framework for both forward and inverse modeling. For the imposition of displacement boundary conditions, this study introduces a new approach based on singular kernel functions into the NeuroPU approximation, leveraging its unique feature that allows for customized basis functions. Numerical experiments demonstrate the NIM method's capability in forward hyperelasticity modeling, achieving desirable accuracy, with errors among $10^{-3} \sim 10^{-5}$ in the relative $L_2$ norm, comparable to the well-established finite element solvers. Furthermore, NIM is applied to address the complex task of identifying heterogeneous mechanical properties of hyperelastic materials from strain data, validating its effectiveness in the inverse modeling of nonlinear materials. To leverage GPU acceleration, NIM is fully implemented on the JAX deep learning framework in this study, utilizing the accelerator-oriented array computation capabilities offered by JAX.">

These architectures augment traditional neural networks by incorporating residual connections, which facilitate smoother weight updates and improve backpropagation efficiency. Results: Through extensive numerical experiments across various examples including linear and nonlinear, time-dependent and independent PDEs we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed architectures. The Squared Residual Network, in particular, exhibits robust performance, achieving enhanced stability and accuracy compared to conventional neural networks. These findings underscore the potential of residual-based architectures in advancing deep learning for PDEs and computational physics applications.">

        <tr id="Flow control is key to maximize energy efficiency in a wide range of applications. However, traditional flow-control methods face significant challenges in addressing non-linear systems and high-dimensional data, limiting their application in realistic energy systems. This study advances deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) methods for flow control, particularly focusing on integrating group-invariant networks and positional encoding into DRL architectures. Our methods leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to exploit policy invariance in space, in combination with group-invariant networks to ensure local symmetry invariance. Additionally, a positional encoding inspired by the transformer architecture is incorporated to provide location information to the agents, mitigating action constraints from strict invariance. The proposed methods are verified using a case study of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, where the goal is to minimize the Nusselt number Nu. The group-invariant neural networks (GI-NNs) show faster convergence compared to the base MARL, achieving better average policy performance. The GI-NNs not only cut DRL training time in half but also notably enhance learning reproducibility. Positional encoding further enhances these results, effectively reducing the minimum Nu and stabilizing convergence. Interestingly, group invariant networks specialize in improving learning speed and positional encoding specializes in improving learning quality. These results demonstrate that choosing a suitable feature-representation method according to the purpose as well as the characteristics of each control problem is essential. We believe that the results of this study will not only inspire novel DRL methods with invariant and unique representations, but also provide useful insights for industrial applications.">

        <tr id="A default assumption in the design of reinforcement-learning algorithms is that a decision-making agent always explores to learn optimal behavior. In sufficiently complex environments that approach the vastness and scale of the real world, however, attaining optimal performance may in fact be an entirely intractable endeavor and an agent may seldom find itself in a position to complete the requisite exploration for identifying an optimal policy. Recent work has leveraged tools from information theory to design agents that deliberately forgo optimal solutions in favor of sufficiently-satisfying or satisficing solutions, obtained through lossy compression. Notably, such agents may employ fundamentally different exploratory decisions to learn satisficing behaviors more efficiently than optimal ones that are more data intensive. While supported by a rigorous corroborating theory, the underlying algorithm relies on model-based planning, drastically limiting the compatibility of these ideas with function approximation and high-dimensional observations. In this work, we remedy this issue by extending an agent that directly represents uncertainty over the optimal value function allowing it to both bypass the need for model-based planning and to learn satisficing policies. We provide simple yet illustrative experiments that demonstrate how our algorithm enables deep reinforcement-learning agents to achieve satisficing behaviors. In keeping with previous work on this setting for multi-armed bandits, we additionally find that our algorithm is capable of synthesizing optimal behaviors, when feasible, more efficiently than its non-information-theoretic counterpart.">

        <tr id="Physics informed neural networks have been gaining popularity due to their unique ability to incorporate physics laws into data-driven models, ensuring that the predictions are not only consistent with empirical data but also align with domain-specific knowledge in the form of physics equations. The integration of physics principles enables the method to require less data while maintaining the robustness of deep learning in modeling complex dynamical systems. However, current PINN frameworks are not sufficiently mature for real-world ODE systems, especially those with extreme multi-scale behavior such as mosquito population dynamical modelling. In this research, we propose a PINN framework with several improvements for forward and inverse problems for ODE systems with a case study application in modelling the dynamics of mosquito populations. The framework tackles the gradient imbalance and stiff problems posed by mosquito ordinary differential equations. The method offers a simple but effective way to resolve the time causality issue in PINNs by gradually expanding the training time domain until it covers entire domain of interest. As part of a robust evaluation, we conduct experiments using simulated data to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach. Preliminary results indicate that physics-informed machine learning holds significant potential for advancing the study of ecological systems.">

However, maintaining spatio-temporal consistency with detailed information from the input static image over time (e.g., style, background, and object of the input static image) and ensuring smoothness in animated video narratives guided by textual prompts still remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce Cinemo, a novel image animation approach towards achieving better motion controllability, as well as stronger temporal consistency and smoothness. In general, we propose three effective strategies at the training and inference stages of Cinemo to accomplish our goal. At the training stage, Cinemo focuses on learning the distribution of motion residuals, rather than directly predicting subsequent via a motion diffusion model. Additionally, a structural similarity index-based strategy is proposed to enable Cinemo to have better controllability of motion intensity. At the inference stage, a noise refinement technique based on discrete cosine transformation is introduced to mitigate sudden motion changes. Such three strategies enable Cinemo to produce highly consistent, smooth, and motion-controllable results. Compared to previous methods, Cinemo offers simpler and more precise user controllability. Extensive experiments against several state-of-the-art methods, including both commercial tools and research approaches, across multiple metrics, demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach.">

Due to manufacturing constraints, the optimization problem falls into the class of NP-complete mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems.

The sensitivities of the objective function are derived such that any gradient-based solver might be applied for the iterative update of the design variables. In a next step, we introduce a material model that is parametric in the design variables of interest and suitable to describe the isotropic deformation behavior of quasi-stochastic lattices. For that, we derive and implement further physical constraints and enhance a physics-augmented neural network from the literature that was formulated initially for rhombic materials. Finally, to illustrate the applicability of the method, we incorporate the material model into our computational framework and exemplary optimize two-and three-dimensional benchmark structures as well as a complex aircraft component.">

Here we suggest that combination of symmetry-aware invariant architectures and stacks of dilated convolutions is a very effective and easy to implement receipt allowing sizable improvements in accuracy over standard approaches.

The discovered concepts can facilitate training manipulation policies and promote generalization. Current methods relying on multimodal foundation models for deriving key states usually lack accuracy and semantic consistency due to limited multimodal robot data. In contrast, we introduce an information-theoretic criterion to characterize the regularities that signify a set of physical states. We also develop a framework that trains a concept discovery network using this criterion, thus bypassing the dependence on human semantics and alleviating costly human labeling. The proposed criterion is based on the observation that key states, which deserve to be conceptualized, often admit more physical constraints than non-key states. This phenomenon can be formalized as maximizing the mutual information between the putative key state and its preceding state, i.e., Maximal Mutual Information (MaxMI). By employing MaxMI, the trained key state localization network can accurately identify states of sufficient physical significance, exhibiting reasonable semantic compatibility with human perception. Furthermore, the proposed framework produces key states that lead to concept-guided manipulation policies with higher success rates and better generalization in various robotic tasks compared to the baselines, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed criterion.">

Many deep-learning-based models are hard to interpret and cumbersome to analyze theoretically. In contrast, our scheme is interpretable because it corresponds to the minimization of a series of convex problems. For each problem in the series, a mask is generated based on the previous solution to refine the regularization strength spatially. In this way, the model becomes progressively attentive to the image structure. For the underlying update operator, we prove the existence of a fixed point. As a special case, we investigate a mask generator for which the fixed-point iterations converge to a critical point of an explicit energy functional. In our experiments, we match the performance of state-of-the-art learned variational models for the solution of inverse problems. Additionally, we offer a promising balance between interpretability, theoretical guarantees, reliability, and performance.">

We show that VFM admits both the CatFlow objective and the original flow matching objective as special cases. We also relate VFM to score-based models, in which the dynamics are stochastic rather than deterministic, and derive a bound on the model likelihood based on a reweighted VFM objective.

In this paper, we present TCAN, a pose-driven human image animation method that is robust to erroneous poses and consistent over time. In contrast to previous methods, we utilize the pre-trained ControlNet without fine-tuning to leverage its extensive pre-acquired knowledge from numerous pose-image-caption pairs. To keep the ControlNet frozen, we adapt LoRA to the UNet layers, enabling the network to align the latent space between the pose and appearance features. Additionally, by introducing an additional temporal layer to the ControlNet, we enhance robustness against outliers of the pose detector. Through the analysis of attention maps over the temporal axis, we also designed a novel temperature map leveraging pose information, allowing for a more static background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve promising results in video synthesis tasks encompassing various poses, like chibi.

        <tr id="How did humanity coax mathematics from the aether? We explore the Platonic view that mathematics can be discovered from its axioms - a game of conjecture and proof. We describe Minimo (Mathematics from Intrinsic Motivation): an agent that jointly learns to pose challenging problems for itself (conjecturing) and solve them (theorem proving). Given a mathematical domain axiomatized in dependent type theory, we first combine methods for constrained decoding and type-directed synthesis to sample valid conjectures from a language model. Our method guarantees well-formed conjectures by construction, even as we start with a randomly initialized model. We use the same model to represent a policy and value function for guiding proof search. Our agent targets generating hard but provable conjectures - a moving target, since its own theorem proving ability also improves as it trains. We propose novel methods for hindsight relabeling on proof search trees to significantly improve the agent's sample efficiency in both tasks. Experiments on 3 axiomatic domains (propositional logic, arithmetic and group theory) demonstrate that our agent can bootstrap from only the axioms, self-improving in generating true and challenging conjectures and in finding proofs.">

However, existing methods struggle with efficient DAG sampling due to the complex acyclicity constraint. In this study, we propose a scalable Bayesian approach to effectively learn the posterior distribution over causal graphs given observational data thanks to the ability to generate DAGs without explicitly enforcing acyclicity. Specifically, we introduce a novel differentiable DAG sampling method that can generate a valid acyclic causal graph by mapping an unconstrained distribution of implicit topological orders to a distribution over DAGs. Given this efficient DAG sampling scheme, we are able to model the posterior distribution over causal graphs using a simple variational distribution over a continuous domain, which can be learned via the variational inference framework. Extensive empirical experiments on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.">

        <tr id="Consistency models are promising generative models as they distill the multi-step sampling of score-based diffusion in a single forward pass of a neural network. Without access to sampling trajectories of a pre-trained diffusion model, consistency training relies on proxy trajectories built on an independent coupling between the noise and data distributions. Refining this coupling is a key area of improvement to make it more adapted to the task and reduce the resulting randomness in the training process. In this work, we introduce a novel coupling associating the input noisy data with their generated output from the consistency model itself, as a proxy to the inaccessible diffusion flow output. Our affordable approach exploits the inherent capacity of consistency models to compute the transport map in a single step. We provide intuition and empirical evidence of the relevance of our generator-induced coupling (GC), which brings consistency training closer to score distillation. Consequently, our method not only accelerates consistency training convergence by significant amounts but also enhances the resulting performance.

As most physical phenomena can be described as Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) , approximating their solutions using neural networks has evolved as a central component of scientific-ML. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is the general method that has evolved for this task but its training is well-known to be very unstable. In this work we explore the possibility of changing the model being trained from being just a neural network to being a non-linear transformation of it - one that algebraically includes the boundary/initial conditions. This reduces the number of terms in the loss function than the standard PINN losses. We demonstrate that our modification leads to significant performance gains across a range of benchmark tasks, in various dimensions and without having to tweak the training algorithm. Our conclusions are based on conducting hundreds of experiments, in the fully unsupervised setting, over multiple linear and non-linear PDEs set to exactly solvable scenarios, which lends to a concrete measurement of our performance gains in terms of order(s) of magnitude lower fractional errors being achieved, than by standard PINNs.

In contrast to traditional conditional models that learn the conditional distribution, ControlVAR jointly models the distribution of image and pixel-level conditions during training and imposes conditional controls during testing. To enhance the joint modeling, we adopt the next-scale AR prediction paradigm and unify control and image representations. A teacher-forcing guidance strategy is proposed to further facilitate controllable generation with joint modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior efficacy and flexibility of ControlVAR across various conditional generation tasks against popular conditional DMs, \eg, ControlNet and T2I-Adaptor.">

To bridge this gap, we introduce MoE Jetpack, an effective method for fine-tuning dense checkpoints into MoE models. MoE Jetpack incorporates two key techniques: (1) checkpoint recycling, which repurposes dense checkpoints as initial weights for MoE models, thereby accelerating convergence, enhancing accuracy, and alleviating the computational burden of pre-training; (2) hyperspherical adaptive MoE (SpheroMoE) layer, which optimizes the MoE architecture for better integration of dense checkpoints, enhancing fine-tuning performance.

However, it is difficult to construct a prediction model for swept wings with various planform geometries because too many samples are required to cover the parameter space. In the present paper, a new model framework is proposed to predict wing surface pressure and friction distributions with fewer samples. The distributed geometry parameters along spanwise are used as model inputs instead of the global planform parameters, and processors are designed to help the model better learn the local effect of geometric variation. The model is trained and tested on simple swept wings with single segment and linear twist distribution, where it outperforms the global input model by 57.6% in terms of lift coefficient prediction errors on small dataset sizes. The distributed input also enables the model to be transferred from single wings to more engineering-practical yet complex kink wings. After fine-tuning with a few samples, model accuracy for kink wings can be similar to that of simple wings, which proves the model for wings with complex planform geometries can be efficiently built with the proposed method.">

        <tr id="Scenario-based optimization and control has proven to be an efficient approach to account for system uncertainty. In particular, the performance of scenario-based model predictive control (MPC) schemes depends on the accuracy of uncertainty quantification. However, current learning- and scenario-based MPC (sMPC) approaches employ a single timeinvariant probabilistic model (learned offline), which may not accurately describe time-varying uncertainties. Instead, this paper presents a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) of Bayesian neural networks (BNN) for adaptive uncertainty quantification that would be subsequently used for adaptive-scenario-tree model predictive control design of nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics to enhance control performance. In particular, the proposed approach learns both a global BNN model and an updating law to refine the BNN model. At each time step, the updating law transforms the global BNN model into more precise local BNN models in real time. The adapted local model is then used to generate scenarios for sMPC design at each time step. A probabilistic safety certificate is incorporated in the scenario generation to ensure that the trajectories of the generated scenarios contain the real trajectory of the system and that all the scenarios adhere to the constraints with a high probability. Experiments using closed-loop simulations of a numerical example demonstrate that the proposed approach can improve the performance of scenario-based MPC compared to using only one BNN model learned offline for all time steps.">

We present a prompt evolution design optimization (PEDO) framework contextualized in a vehicle design scenario that leverages a vision-language model for penalizing impractical car designs synthesized by a generative model. The backbone of our framework is an evolutionary strategy coupled with an optimization objective function that comprises a physics-based solver and a vision-language model for practical or functional guidance in the generated car designs. In the prompt evolutionary search, the optimizer iteratively generates a population of text prompts, which embed user specifications on the aerodynamic performance and visual preferences of the 3D car designs. Then, in addition to the computational fluid dynamics simulations, the pre-trained vision-language model is used to penalize impractical designs and, thus, foster the evolutionary algorithm to seek more viable designs. Our investigations on a car design optimization problem show a wide spread of potential car designs generated at the early phase of the search, which indicates a good diversity of designs in the initial populations, and an increase of over 20\% in the probability of generating practical designs compared to a baseline framework without using a vision-language model. Visual inspection of the designs against the performance results demonstrates prompt evolution as a very promising paradigm for finding novel designs with good optimization performance while providing ease of use in specifying design specifications and preferences via a natural language interface.">

Automatic differentiation has played a pivotal role in this progress, enabling the creation of physics-informed neural networks (PINN) that integrate relevant physics into machine learning models. PINN have shown promise in approximating the solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, overcoming the limitations of traditional numerical discretization methods. However, challenges such as local minima and long training times persist, motivating the exploration of domain decomposition techniques to improve it. Previous domain decomposition models have introduced spatial and temporal domain decompositions but have yet to fully address issues of smoothness and regularity of global solutions. In this study, we present a novel domain decomposition approach for PINN, termed domain-discretized PINN (DD-PINN), which incorporates complementary loss functions, subdomain-specific transformer networks (TRF), and independent optimization within each subdomain. By enforcing continuity and differentiability through interface constraints and leveraging the Sobolev (H 1) norm of the mean squared error (MSE), rather than the Euclidean norm (L 2), DD-PINN enhances solution regularity and accuracy. The inclusion of TRF in each subdomain facilitates feature extraction and improves convergence rates, as demonstrated through simulations of threetest problems: steady-state flow in a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity, the time-dependent cylinder wake, and the viscous Burgers equation. Numerical comparisons highlight the effectiveness of DD-PINN in preserving global solution regularity and accurately approximating complex phenomena, marking a significant advancement over previous domain decomposition methods within the PINN framework.">

Among these methods, many rely on the assumption that the most likely graph is among the shortest ones. In this paper, we propose a new approach to build short ARGs: Reinforcement Learning (RL). We exploit the similarities between finding the shortest path between a set of genetic sequences and their most recent common ancestor and finding the shortest path between the entrance and exit of a maze, a classic RL problem. In the maze problem, the learner, called the agent, must learn the directions to take in order to escape as quickly as possible, whereas in our problem, the agent must learn the actions to take between coalescence, mutation, and recombination in order to reach the most recent common ancestor as quickly as possible. Our results show that RL can be used to build ARGs as short as those built with a heuristic algorithm optimized to build short ARGs, and sometimes even shorter. Moreover, our method allows to build a distribution of short ARGs for a given sample, and can also generalize learning to new samples not used during the learning process.">

However, it remains unclear if the integration of mechanical properties into the dataset used to train such machine learning models would be beneficial beyond using geometric data alone. To address this issue, this work implements and evaluates a hybrid geometry/property Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for generating multi-lattice transition regions.

        <tr id="$\textbf{This is the conference version of our paper: Spatiotemporal Implicit Neural Representation as a Generalized Traffic Data Learner}$. Spatiotemporal Traffic Data (STTD) measures the complex dynamical behaviors of the multiscale transportation system. Existing methods aim to reconstruct STTD using low-dimensional models. However, they are limited to data-specific dimensions or source-dependent patterns, restricting them from unifying representations. Here, we present a novel paradigm to address the STTD learning problem by parameterizing STTD as an implicit neural representation. To discern the underlying dynamics in low-dimensional regimes, coordinate-based neural networks that can encode high-frequency structures are employed to directly map coordinates to traffic variables. To unravel the entangled spatial-temporal interactions, the variability is decomposed into separate processes. We further enable modeling in irregular spaces such as sensor graphs using spectral embedding. Through continuous representations, our approach enables the modeling of a variety of STTD with a unified input, thereby serving as a generalized learner of the underlying traffic dynamics. It is also shown that it can learn implicit low-rank priors and smoothness regularization from the data, making it versatile for learning different dominating data patterns. We validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments in real-world scenarios, showcasing applications from corridor to network scales. Empirical results not only indicate that our model has significant superiority over conventional low-rank models, but also highlight that the versatility of the approach.

        <tr id="Machine-learned coarse-grained (MLCG) molecular dynamics is a promising option for modeling biomolecules. However, MLCG models currently require large amounts of data from reference atomistic molecular dynamics or substantial computation for training. Denoising score matching -- the technology behind the widely popular diffusion models -- has simultaneously emerged as a machine-learning framework for creating samples from noise. Models in the first category are often trained using atomistic forces, while those in the second category extract the data distribution by reverting noise-based corruption. We unify these approaches to improve the training of MLCG force-fields, reducing data requirements by a factor of 100 while maintaining advantages typical to force-based parameterization. The methods are demonstrated on proteins Trp-Cage and NTL9 and published as open-source code.">

Traditional modeling approaches require extensive domain knowledge, often leading to a shift towards data-driven methods using machine learning. However, existing research provides inconclusive results on which machine learning methods are best suited for predicting chaotic systems. In this paper, we compare different lightweight and heavyweight machine learning architectures using extensive existing databases, as well as a newly introduced one that allows for uncertainty quantification in the benchmark results. We perform hyperparameter tuning based on computational cost and introduce a novel error metric, the cumulative maximum error, which combines several desirable properties of traditional metrics, tailored for chaotic systems. Our results show that well-tuned simple methods, as well as untuned baseline methods, often outperform state-of-the-art deep learning models, but their performance can vary significantly with different experimental setups. These findings underscore the importance of matching prediction methods to data characteristics and available computational resources.">

        <tr id="The Dynamical Graph Grammar (DGG) formalism can describe complex system dynamics with graphs that are mapped into a master equation. An exact stochastic simulation algorithm may be used, but it is slow for large systems. To overcome this problem, an approximate spatial stochastic/deterministic simulation algorithm, which uses spatial decomposition of the system's time-evolution operator through an expanded cell complex (ECC), was previously developed and implemented for a cortical microtubule array (CMA) model. Here, computational efficiency is improved at the cost of introducing errors confined to interactions between adjacent subdomains of different dimensions, realized as some events occurring out of order. A rule instances to domains mapping function $\phi$, ensures the errors are local. This approach has been further refined and generalized in this work. Additional efficiency is achieved by maintaining an incrementally updated match data structure for all possible rule matches. The API has been redesigned to support DGG rules in general, rather than for one specific model. To demonstrate these improvements in the algorithm, we have developed the Dynamical Graph Grammar Modeling Library (DGGML) and a DGG model for the periclinal face of the plant cell CMA. This model explores the effects of face shape and boundary conditions on local and global alignment. For a rectangular face, different boundary conditions reorient the array between the long and short axes. The periclinal CMA DGG demonstrates the flexibility and utility of DGGML, and these new methods highlight DGGs' potential for testing, screening, or generating hypotheses to explain emergent phenomena.">

To address these issues, we introduce RACon: Retrieval-Augmented Simulated Character Locomotion Control. Our end-to-end hierarchical reinforcement learning method utilizes a retriever and a motion controller. The retriever searches motion experts from a user-specified database in a task-oriented fashion, which boosts the responsiveness to the user's control. The selected motion experts and the manipulation signal are then transferred to the controller to drive the simulated character. In addition, a retrieval-augmented discriminator is designed to stabilize the training process. Our method surpasses existing techniques in both quality and quantity in locomotion control, as demonstrated in our empirical study.

Therefore, developing reduced dimensionality representations that encapsulate complex correlation effects in many-body systems is crucial to advance the understanding of these complicated problems. However, a numerical evaluation of these predictive models can still be associated with a significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, in this paper, we discuss a combined framework that integrates recent advances in the development of active-space representations of coupled cluster (CC) downfolded Hamiltonians with neural network approaches. The primary objective of this effort is to train neural networks to eliminate the computationally expensive steps required for evaluating hundreds or thousands of Hugenholtz diagrams, which correspond to multidimensional tensor contractions necessary for evaluating a many-body form of downfolded/effective Hamiltonians. Using small molecular systems (the H2O and HF molecules) as examples, we demonstrate that training neural networks employing effective Hamiltonians for a few nuclear geometries of molecules can accurately interpolate/ extrapolate their forms to other geometrical configurations characterized by different intensities of correlation effects. We also discuss differences between effective interactions that define CC downfolded Hamiltonians with those of bare Hamiltonians defined by Coulomb interactions in the active spaces.">

However, how to decompose the material properties from the implicit representation for relighting has not yet been investigated thoroughly. We propose to address this problem with a novel framework, ReN Human, that takes sparse or even monocular input videos collected in unconstrained lighting to produce a 3D human representation that can be rendered with novel views, poses, and lighting. Our method represents humans as deformable implicit neural representation and decomposes the geometry, material of humans as well as environment illumination for capturing a relightable and animatable human model. Moreover, we introduce a volumetric lighting grid consisting of spherical Gaussian mixtures to learn the spatially varying illumination and animatable visibility probes to model the dynamic self-occlusion caused by human motion. Specifically, we learn the material property fields and illumination using a physically-based rendering layer that uses Monte Carlo importance sampling to facilitate differentiation of the complex rendering integral. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms recent novel views and poses synthesis methods in a challenging benchmark with sparse videos, enabling high-fidelity human relighting.">

Unfortunately, this task is known to be hard, especially for spin glasses at low temperatures. Recently, many attempts have been made to tackle the problem by mixing classical Monte Carlo schemes with newly devised Neural Networks that learn to propose smart moves. In this article we introduce the Nearest-Neighbours Neural Network (4N) architecture, a physically-interpretable deep architecture whose number of parameters scales linearly with the size of the system and that can be applied to a large variety of topologies. We show that the 4N architecture can accurately learn the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution for the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model, and specifically for some of its most difficult instances. In particular, it captures properties such as the energy, the correlation function and the overlap probability distribution. Finally, we show that the 4N performance increases with the number of layers, in a way that clearly connects to the correlation length of the system, thus providing a simple and interpretable criterion to choose the optimal depth.">

First, as each point in the space corresponds to an identity, sampling a set of weights from it results in a model encoding a novel identity. Next, we find linear directions in this space corresponding to semantic edits of the identity (e.g., adding a beard). These edits persist in appearance across generated samples. Finally, we show that inverting a single image into this space reconstructs a realistic identity, even if the input image is out of distribution (e.g., a painting).

Leveraging recent work on modeling PDEs in modal and nodal spaces, we present a neural network structure that is suitable for PDE modeling with noisy and limited data available only on a subset of the state variables or computational domain. In particular, spatial grid-point measurements are reduced using a learned linear transformation, after which the dynamics are learned in this reduced basis before being transformed back out to the nodal space. This approach yields a drastically reduced parameterization of the neural network compared with previous flow map models for nodal space learning.

More recent data-driven techniques use neural networks to enable nonlinear projections. Whilst those often enable stronger compression, they may have redundant parameters and lead to suboptimal latent dimensionality. To overcome these, we propose a multistep algorithm that induces sparsity in the encoder-decoder networks for effective reduction in the number of parameters and additional compression of the latent space. This algorithm starts with sparsely initialized a network and training it using linearized Bregman iterations. These iterations have been very successful in computer vision and compressed sensing tasks, but have not yet been used for reduced-order modelling. After the training, we further compress the latent space dimensionality by using a form of proper orthogonal decomposition. Last, we use a bias propagation technique to change the induced sparsity into an effective reduction of parameters. We apply this algorithm to three representative PDE models: 1D diffusion, 1D advection, and 2D reaction-diffusion. Compared to conventional training methods like Adam, the proposed method achieves similar accuracy with 30% less parameters and a significantly smaller latent space.">

In this work, two deep-learning methods are proposed that provably satisfy the first and second conditions on a large-enough region of thermodynamic variable space. The first is based on learning the generating function (thermodynamic potential) while the second is based on structure-preserving, symplectic neural networks, respectively allowing modifications near or on phase transition regions.

        <tr id="When neural networks are trained from data to simulate the dynamics of physical systems, they encounter a persistent challenge: the long-time dynamics they produce are often unphysical or unstable. We analyze the origin of such instabilities when learning linear dynamical systems, focusing on the training dynamics. We make several analytical findings which empirical observations suggest extend to nonlinear dynamical systems. First, the rate of convergence of the training dynamics is uneven and depends on the distribution of energy in the data. As a special case, the dynamics in directions where the data have no energy cannot be learned. Second, in the unlearnable directions, the dynamics produced by the neural network depend on the weight initialization, and common weight initialization schemes can produce unstable dynamics. Third, injecting synthetic noise into the data during training adds damping to the training dynamics and can stabilize the learned simulator, though doing so undesirably biases the learned dynamics. For each contributor to instability, we suggest mitigative strategies. We also highlight important differences between learning discrete-time and continuous-time dynamics, and discuss extensions to nonlinear systems.">

        <tr id="In this work, we introduce Pixelsmith, a zero-shot text-to-image generative framework to sample images at higher resolutions with a single GPU. We are the first to show that it is possible to scale the output of a pre-trained diffusion model by a factor of 1000, opening the road for gigapixel image generation at no additional cost. Our cascading method uses the image generated at the lowest resolution as a baseline to sample at higher resolutions. For the guidance, we introduce the Slider, a tunable mechanism that fuses the overall structure contained in the first-generated image with enhanced fine details. At each inference step, we denoise patches rather than the entire latent space, minimizing memory demands such that a single GPU can handle the process, regardless of the image's resolution. Our experimental results show that Pixelsmith not only achieves higher quality and diversity compared to existing techniques, but also reduces sampling time and artifacts.

Specifically, $L_0$+SVGD demonstrates superior resilience to noise, the ability to perform well in extrapolated regions, and a faster convergence rate to an optimal solution.">

        <tr id="Advancements in computer sciences and technology allow for implementation of detailed numerical models of a system such as the Finite Element (FE) or Multibody Dynamics (MBD) models. Complex mechanical systems can easily be modelled in detail, yielding accurate results. This opportunity provided by these high-fidelity numerical models has led to the broad application of such methods in development and prototyping of mechanical systems, their optimization and fault analysis and so on. The capability of detailed modelling however usually comes at a great computational cost, with the simulation time needed for a problem in many cases rising exponentially, rendering these models impractical. This problem becomes even more profound when one considers the recent integration of model-based data in data-driven methods where a large number of datasets is usually required, and multiple iterations of the same model must be simulated in order to produce the desired number of samples. To mitigate these short-comings, surrogate modelling has been extensively used in applications including large systems or repetitive runs in the form of Reduced Order Models (ROMs) to reduce the computations time and render these simulation-driven methods more viable. Use of these ROMs however is limited to cases where low loss of information is ensured, and the features lost due to the model simplification are insignificant. The developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its applications have demonstrated its potential to accurately describe the relationships between a model’s inputs and outputs and as such using an AI algorithm as a surrogate model is a promising alternative. A properly trained AI algorithm can usually fit to FE and MBD models and yield accurate results at a fraction of the computational burden. To this end, an AI-based surrogate modelling framework is proposed in this work, with application on an experimental gear drivetrain system. A detailed MBD of the actual system is initially constructed and optimized via a black box optimization method in order to better simulate the physical system. A variety of supervised AI algorithms such as regression models and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is then examined as a surrogate to the various mechanisms of the system, aiming to replace them with the goal of reducing the simulation time while maintaining the high accuracy and fidelity of the original model. The various algorithms are then compared in terms of time reduction and accuracy both to each other and to the initial MBD model in order to conclude to the best suited for the application. The results are also compared to the measured response data of the physical system to ensure the validity of the models and prove the viability of the proposed method through its use on a relatively complex model. The proposed framework provides an alternative to the commonly used ROM methods and the presented application acts as a benchmark case for its implementation to more complex systems and different operating conditions.">

Learning‐based controllers that leverage efficient mechanical models are promising for solving complex interaction tasks. This article develops a closed‐loop pose/force controller for a dexterous soft manipulator enabling dynamic pushing tasks using deep reinforcement learning. Force tests investigate the mechanical properties of a soft robot module, resulting in orthogonal forces of  N. Then, the policy is trained in simulation leveraging a dynamic Cosserat rod model of the soft robot. Domain randomization mitigate the sim‐to‐real gap while careful reward engineering induced pose and force control even without explicit force inputs. Despite the approximate simulation, the sim‐to‐real transfer achieved an average reaching distance of  mm (), an average orientation error of  rad () and applied pushing forces up to  N. Such performance is reasonable for the intended assistive tasks of the manipulator. The experiments uncovered that the soft robot interacting with the environment exhibited torsional and counter‐balancing movements. Although not explicitly enforced, they emerged from the mechanical intelligence of the manipulator. The results demonstrate the potential of soft robotic manipulation via reinforcement learning.">

By introducing a Least Squares solver for the weights of the last layer of the neural network, we improve the convergence of the loss during training in most practical scenarios. This work analyzes the computational cost of the resulting hybrid Least-Squares/Gradient-Descent optimizer and explains how to implement it efficiently. In particular, we show that a traditional implementation based on backward-mode automatic differentiation leads to a prohibitively expensive algorithm. To remedy this, we propose using either forward-mode automatic differentiation or an ultraweak-type scheme that avoids the differentiation of trial functions in the discrete weak formulation. The proposed alternatives are up to 100 times faster than the traditional one, recovering a computational cost-per-iteration similar to that of a conventional gradient-descent-based optimizer alone. To support our analysis, we derive computational estimates and conduct numerical experiments in one- and two-dimensional problems.">

Such approaches are of great value in various areas of research, e.g., in the development of new therapeutics. The accurate description of solvation effects in such simulations is thereby key and has in consequence been an active field of research since the introduction of MD. So far, the most accurate approaches involve computationally expensive explicit solvent simulations, while widely applied models using an implicit solvent description suffer from reduced accuracy. Recently, machine learning (ML) approaches that provide a probabilistic representation of solvation effects have been proposed as potential alternatives. However, the associated computational costs and minimal or lack of transferability render them unusable in practice. Here, we report the first example of a transferable ML-based implicit solvent model trained on a diverse set of 3 000 000 molecular structures that can be applied to organic small molecules for simulations in water. Extensive testing against reference calculations demonstrated that the model delivers on par accuracy with explicit solvent simulations while providing an up to 18-fold increase in sampling rate.">

        <tr id="Physical learning is an emerging paradigm in science and engineering whereby (meta)materials acquire desired macroscopic behaviors by exposure to examples. So far, it has been applied to static properties such as elastic moduli and self-assembled structures encoded in minima of an energy landscape. Here, we extend this paradigm to dynamic functionalities, such as motion and shape change, that are instead encoded in limit cycles or pathways of a dynamical system. We identify the two ingredients needed to learn time-dependent behaviors irrespective of experimental platforms: (i) learning rules with time delays and (ii) exposure to examples that break time-reversal symmetry during training. After providing a hands-on demonstration of these requirements using programmable LEGO toys, we turn to realistic particle-based simulations where the training rules are not programmed on a computer. Instead, we elucidate how they emerge from physico-chemical processes involving the causal propagation of fields, like in recent experiments on moving oil droplets with chemotactic signalling. Our trainable particles can self-assemble into structures that move or change shape on demand, either by retrieving the dynamic behavior previously seen during training, or by learning on the fly. This rich phenomenology is captured by a modified Hopfield spin model amenable to analytical treatment. The principles illustrated here provide a step towards von Neumann's dream of engineering synthetic living systems that adapt to the environment.">

Through comparative experiments we demonstrate that these adaptive features significantly enhance training efficiency and solution accuracy.

Consistency-FM directly defines straight flows starting from different times to the same endpoint, imposing constraints on their velocity values. Additionally, we propose a multi-segment training approach for Consistency-FM to enhance expressiveness, achieving a better trade-off between sampling quality and speed. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that our Consistency-FM significantly improves training efficiency by converging 4.4x faster than consistency models and 1.7x faster than rectified flow models while achieving better generation quality.

However, scientists often have strong intuition, and thus human feedback is still useful. Nevertheless, prior works in enhancing BO with expert feedback, such as by incorporating it in an offline or online but blocking (arrives at each BO iteration) manner, are incompatible with the spirit of self-driving labs. In this work, we study whether a small amount of randomly arriving expert feedback that is being incorporated in a non-blocking manner can improve a BO campaign. To this end, we run an additional, independent computing thread on top of the BO loop to handle the feedback-gathering process. The gathered feedback is used to learn a Bayesian preference model that can readily be incorporated into the BO thread, to steer its exploration-exploitation process. Experiments on toy and chemistry datasets suggest that even just a few intermittent, asynchronous expert feedback can be useful for improving or constraining BO. This can especially be useful for its implication in improving self-driving labs, e.g. making them more data-efficient and less costly.">

        <tr id="We describe a representation targeted for anatomic objects which is designed to enable strong locational correspondence within object populations and thus to provide powerful object statistics. The method generates fitted frames on the boundary and in the interior of objects and produces alignment-free geometric features from them. It accomplishes this by understanding an object as the diffeomorphic deformation of an ellipsoid and using a skeletal representation fitted throughout the deformation to produce a model of the target object, where the object is provided initially in the form of a boundary mesh. Via classification performance on hippocampi shape between individuals with a disorder vs. others, we compare our method to two state-of-the-art methods for producing object representations that are intended to capture geometric correspondence across a population of objects and to yield geometric features useful for statistics, and we show improved classification performance by this new representation, which we call the evolutionary s-rep. The geometric features that are derived from each of the representations, especially via fitted frames, is discussed.">

        <tr id="Parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) appear in many disciplines to model the evolution of various mathematical objects, such as probability flows, value functions in control theory, and derivative prices in finance. It is often necessary to compute the solutions or a function of the solutions to a parametric PDE in multiple scenarios corresponding to different parameters of this PDE. This process often requires resolving the PDEs from scratch, which is time-consuming. To better employ existing simulations for the PDEs, we propose a framework for finding solutions to parabolic PDEs across different scenarios by meta-learning an underlying base distribution. We build upon this base distribution to propose a method for computing solutions to parametric PDEs under different parameter settings. Finally, we illustrate the application of the proposed methods through extensive experiments in generative modeling, stochastic control, and finance. The empirical results suggest that the proposed approach improves generalization to solving PDEs under new parameter regimes.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a significant advancement in scientific machine learning by integrating fundamental physical laws into their architecture through loss functions. PINNs have been successfully applied to solve various forward and inverse problems in partial differential equations (PDEs). However, a notable challenge can emerge during the early training stages when solving inverse problems. Specifically, data losses remain high while PDE residual losses are minimized rapidly, thereby exacerbating the imbalance between loss terms and impeding the overall efficiency of PINNs. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel framework termed data-guided physics-informed neural networks (DG-PINNs). The DG-PINNs framework is structured into two distinct phases: a pre-training phase and a fine-tuning phase. In the pre-training phase, a loss function with only the data loss is minimized in a neural network. In the fine-tuning phase, a composite loss function, which consists of the data loss, PDE residual loss, and, if available, initial and boundary condition losses, is minimized in the same neural network. Notably, the pre-training phase ensures that the data loss is already at a low value before the fine-tuning phase commences. This approach enables the fine-tuning phase to converge to a minimal composite loss function with fewer iterations compared to existing PINNs. To validate the effectiveness, noise-robustness, and efficiency of DG-PINNs, extensive numerical investigations are conducted on inverse problems related to several classical PDEs, including the heat equation, wave equation, Euler--Bernoulli beam equation, and Navier--Stokes equation. The numerical results demonstrate that DG-PINNs can accurately solve these inverse problems and exhibit robustness against noise in training data.">

        <tr id="In recent years, surrogate models based on deep neural networks have been widely used to solve partial differential equations for fluid flow physics. This kind of model focuses on global interpolation of the training data and thus requires a large network structure. The process is both time consuming and computationally costly. In the present study, we develop a neural network with local converging input (NNLCI) for high-fidelity prediction using unstructured data. The framework uses the local domain of dependence with converging coarse solutions as input, thereby greatly reducing computational resource and training time. As a validation case, the NNLCI method is applied to study two-dimensional inviscid supersonic flows in channels with bumps. Different bump geometries and locations are examined to benchmark the effectiveness and versatility of this new approach. The NNLCI method can accurately and efficiently capture the structure and dynamics of the entire flowfield, including regions with shock discontinuities. For a new bump configuration, the method can perform prediction with only one neural network, eliminating the need for repeated training of multiple networks for different geometries. A saving of computing wall time is achieved by several orders of magnitude against the high-fidelity simulation with the same level of accuracy. The demand on training data is modest, and the training data can be allocated sparsely. These features are especially advantageous compared with conventional global-to-global deep learning methods and physics-informed methods.">

However, while these projects represent a step-change in scale, they retain a traditional structure with centralised funding, participating laboratories and data sharing on publication. Inspired by an open-source project in pure mathematics, we set out to test the feasibility of an alternative structure by running a grassroots, massively collaborative project in computational neuroscience. To do so, we launched a public Git repository, with code for training spiking neural networks to solve a sound localisation task via surrogate gradient descent. We then invited anyone, anywhere to use this code as a springboard for exploring questions of interest to them, and encouraged participants to share their work both asynchro-nously through Git and synchronously at monthly online workshops. At a scientific level, our work investigated how a range of biologically-relevant parameters, from time delays to mem-brane time constants and levels of inhibition, could impact sound localisation in networks of spiking units. At a more macro-level, our project brought together 31 researchers from multiple countries, provided hands-on research experience to early career participants, and opportunities for supervision and teaching to later career participants. Looking ahead, our project provides a glimpse of what open, collaborative science could look like and provides a necessary, tentative step towards it.">

Our objective has a simple form -- it is a mixture of classical masked language modeling losses -- and can be used to train encoder-only language models that admit efficient samplers, including ones that can generate arbitrary lengths of text semi-autoregressively like a traditional language model.

        <tr id="We present a domain decomposition strategy for developing structure-preserving finite element discretizations from data when exact governing equations are unknown. On subdomains, trainable Whitney form elements are used to identify structure-preserving models from data, providing a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map which may be used to globally construct a mortar method. The reduced-order local elements may be trained offline to reproduce high-fidelity Dirichlet data in cases where first principles model derivation is either intractable, unknown, or computationally prohibitive. In such cases, particular care must be taken to preserve structure on both local and mortar levels without knowledge of the governing equations, as well as to ensure well-posedness and stability of the resulting monolithic data-driven system. This strategy provides a flexible means of both scaling to large systems and treating complex geometries, and is particularly attractive for multiscale problems with complex microstructure geometry. While consistency is traditionally obtained in finite element methods via quasi-optimality results and the Bramble-Hilbert lemma as the local element diameter $h\rightarrow0$, our analysis establishes notions of accuracy and stability for finite h with accuracy coming from matching data. Numerical experiments and analysis establish properties for $H(\operatorname{div})$ problems in small data limits ($\mathcal{O}(1)$ reference solutions).">

        <tr id="In this work, we explore the numerical solution of geometric shape optimization problems using neural network-based approaches. This involves minimizing a numerical criterion that includes solving a partial differential equation with respect to a domain, often under geometric constraints like constant volume. Our goal is to develop a proof of concept using a flexible and parallelizable methodology to tackle these problems. We focus on a prototypal problem: minimizing the so-called Dirichlet energy with respect to the domain under a volume constraint, involving a Poisson equation in $\mathbb R^2$. We use physics-informed neural networks (PINN) to approximate the Poisson equation's solution on a given domain and represent the shape through a neural network that approximates a volume-preserving transformation from an initial shape to an optimal one. These processes are combined in a single optimization algorithm that minimizes the Dirichlet energy. One of the significant advantages of this approach is its parallelizable nature, which makes it easy to handle the addition of parameters. Additionally, it does not rely on shape derivative or adjoint calculations. Our approach is tested on Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions, parametric right-hand sides, and extended to Bernoulli-type free boundary problems. The source code for solving the shape optimization problem is open-source and freely available.">

Its success in standard vision is attributed to the maturity of feature extraction, data association and multi-view geometry. The recent emergence of neuromorphic event-based cameras places great demands on approaches that use raw event data as input to solve this fundamental problem.Existing state-of-the-art solutions typically infer implicitly data association by iteratively reversing the event data generation process. However, the nonlinear nature of these methods limits their applicability in real-time tasks, and the constant-motion assumption leads to unstable results under agile motion. To this end, we rethink the problem formulation in a way that aligns better with the differential working principle of event cameras.We show that the event-based normal flow can be used, via the proposed geometric error term, as an alternative to the full flow in solving a family of geometric problems that involve instantaneous first-order kinematics and scene geometry. Furthermore, we develop a fast linear solver and a continuous-time nonlinear solver on top of the proposed geometric error term.Experiments on both synthetic and real data show the superiority of our linear solver in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and indicate its complementary feature as an initialization method for existing nonlinear solvers. Besides, our continuous-time non-linear solver exhibits exceptional capability in accommodating sudden variations in motion since it does not rely on the constant-motion assumption.">

In this direction of research, this work introduces a physics-informed neural network (PiNN) to learn the unknown parameters of an interpretable wildfire spreading model. The considered wildfire spreading model integrates fundamental physical laws articulated by key model parameters, essential for capturing the complex behavior of wildfires. The proposed machine learning approach leverages the theory of artificial neural networks with the physical constraints governing wildfire dynamics, such as the first principles of mass and energy conservation. Training of the PiNN for physics-informed parameter identification is realized using data of the temporal evolution of one- and two-dimensional (plane surface) fire fronts that have been obtained from a high-fidelity simulator of the wildfire spreading model under consideration. The parameter learning results demonstrate the remarkable predictive ability of the proposed PiNN in uncovering the unknown coefficients in both the one- and two-dimensional fire spreading scenarios. Additionally, this methodology exhibits robustness by identifying the same parameters in the presence of noisy data. The proposed framework is envisioned to be incorporated in a physics-informed digital twin for intelligent wildfire management and risk assessment.">

This study explores a co-design strategy for pneumatically actuated soft grippers with multiple encoded stable states, enabling desired functional shape and stiffness reconfiguration. An energy based analytical model for soft multistable grippers is presented, mapping the robots' infinite-dimensional configuration space into discrete stable states, allowing for prediction of the systems final state and dynamic behavior. Our approach introduces a general method to capture the soft robots' response with the lattice lumped parameters using automatic relevance determination regression, facilitating inverse co-design. The resulting computationally efficient model enables us to explore the configuration space in a tractable manner, allowing the inverse co-design of our robots by setting desired targeted positions with optimized stiffness of the set targets. This strategy offers a framework for controlling soft robots by exploiting the nonlinear mechanics of multistable structures, thus embodying mechanical intelligence into soft structures.">

        <tr id="We propose physics-informed holomorphic neural networks (PIHNNs) as a method to solve boundary value problems where the solution can be represented via holomorphic functions. Specifically, we consider the case of plane linear elasticity and, by leveraging the Kolosov-Muskhelishvili representation of the solution in terms of holomorphic potentials, we train a complex-valued neural network to fulfill stress and displacement boundary conditions while automatically satisfying the governing equations. This is achieved by designing the network to return only approximations that inherently satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann conditions through specific choices of layers and activation functions. To ensure generality, we provide a universal approximation theorem guaranteeing that, under basic assumptions, the proposed holomorphic neural networks can approximate any holomorphic function. Furthermore, we suggest a new tailored weight initialization technique to mitigate the issue of vanishing/exploding gradients. Compared to the standard PINN approach, noteworthy benefits of the proposed method for the linear elasticity problem include a more efficient training, as evaluations are needed solely on the boundary of the domain, lower memory requirements, due to the reduced number of training points, and $C^\infty$ regularity of the learned solution. Several benchmark examples are used to verify the correctness of the obtained PIHNN approximations, the substantial benefits over traditional PINNs, and the possibility to deal with non-trivial, multiply-connected geometries via a domain-decomposition strategy.">

        <tr id="This study briefly describes the concept of guided training of deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn physically reasonable solutions. The proposed method does not need the gradients of the physical equations, although the conventional physics-informed models need the gradients. DNNs are widely used to predict phenomena in physics and mechanics. One of the issues with DNNs is that their output does not always satisfy physical equations. One approach to consider with physical equations is adding a residual of the equations into the loss function; this is called physics-informed neural network (PINN). One feature of PINNs is that the physical equations and corresponding residuals must be implemented as part of a neural network model. In addition, the residual does not always converge to a small value. The proposed model is a physics-guided generative adversarial network (PG-GAN) that uses a GAN architecture, in which physical equations are used to judge whether the neural network’s output is consistent with physics. The proposed method was applied to a simple problem to assess its potential usability.">

        <tr id="We present an application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to handle MultiPhase-Field simulations of microstructure evolution. It has been showcased that a combination of optimization techniques extended and adapted from the PINNs literature, and the introduction of specific techniques inspired by the MPF Method background, is required. The numerical resolution is realized through a multi-variable time-series problem by using fully discrete resolution. Within each interval, space, time, and phases are treated separately, constituting discrete subdomains. An extended multi-networking concept is implemented to subdivide the simulation domain into multiple batches, with each batch associated with an independent Neural Network trained to predict the solution. To ensure efficient interaction across different phasesand in the spatio-temporal-phasic subdomain, a Master NN handles efficient interaction among the multiple networks, as well as the transfer of learning in different directions. A set of systematic simulations with increasing complexity was performed, that benchmarks various critical aspects of MPF simulations, including different geometries, types of interface dynamics and the evolution of an interfacial triple junction. A comprehensive approach is adopted to specifically focus the attention on the interfacial regions through an automatic and dynamic meshing process, significantly simplifying the tuning of hyper-parameters and serving as a fundamental key for addressing MPF problems using Machine Learning. The pyramidal training approach is proposed to the PINN community as a dual-impact method: it facilitates the initialization of training and allows an extended transfer of learning. The proposed PINNs-MPF framework successfully reproduces benchmark tests with high fidelity and Mean Squared Error loss values ranging from 10$^{-4}$ to 10$^{-6}$ compared to ground truth solutions.">

        <tr id="Physics‐Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have solved numerous mechanics problems by training to minimize the loss functions of governing partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite successful development of PINNs in various systems, computational efficiency and fidelity prediction have remained profound challenges. To fill such gaps, this study proposed a Physics‐Informed Neural Operator Solver (PINOS) to achieve accurate and fast simulations without any required data set. The training of PINOS adopts a weak form based on the principle of least work for static simulations and a storng form for dynamic systems in solid mechanics. Results from numerical examples indicated that PINOS is capable of approximating solutions notably faster than the benchmarks of PINNs in both static an dynamic systems. The comparisons also showed that PINOS reached a convergence speed of over 20 times faster than finite element software in two‐dimensional and three‐dimensional static problems. Furthermore, this study examined the zero‐shot super‐resolution capability by developing Super‐Resolution PINOS (SR‐PINOS) that was trained on a coarse mesh and validated on fine mesh. The numerical results demonstrate the great performance of the model to obtain accurate solutions with a speed up, suggesting effectiveness in increasing sampling points and scaling a simulation. This study also discusses the differentiation methods of PINOS and SR‐PINOS and suggests potential implementations related to forward applications for promising machine learning methods for structural designs and optimization.">

        <tr id="In classic Reinforcement Learning (RL), the agent maximizes an additive objective of the visited states, e.g., a value function. Unfortunately, objectives of this type cannot model many real-world applications such as experiment design, exploration, imitation learning, and risk-averse RL to name a few. This is due to the fact that additive objectives disregard interactions between states that are crucial for certain tasks. To tackle this problem, we introduce Global RL (GRL), where rewards are globally defined over trajectories instead of locally over states. Global rewards can capture negative interactions among states, e.g., in exploration, via submodularity, positive interactions, e.g., synergetic effects, via supermodularity, while mixed interactions via combinations of them. By exploiting ideas from submodular optimization, we propose a novel algorithmic scheme that converts any GRL problem to a sequence of classic RL problems and solves it efficiently with curvature-dependent approximation guarantees. We also provide hardness of approximation results and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several GRL instances.">
