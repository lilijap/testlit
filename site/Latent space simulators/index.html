        <tr id="Small integration time steps limit molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to millisecond time scales. Markov state models (MSMs) and equation-free approaches learn low-dimensional kinetic models from MD simulation data by performing configurational or dynamical coarse-graining of the state space. The learned kinetic models enable the efficient generation of dynamical trajectories over vastly longer time scales than are accessible by MD, but the discretization of configurational space and/or absence of a means to reconstruct molecular configurations precludes the generation of continuous atomistic molecular trajectories. We propose latent space simulators (LSS) to learn kinetic models for continuous atomistic simulation trajectories by training three deep learning networks to (i) learn the slow collective variables of the molecular system, (ii) propagate the system dynamics within this slow latent space, and (iii) generatively reconstruct molecular configurations. We demonstrate the approach in an application to Trp-cage miniprotein to produce novel ultra-long synthetic folding trajectories that accurately reproduce atomistic molecular structure, thermodynamics, and kinetics at six orders of magnitude lower cost than MD. The dramatically lower cost of trajectory generation enables greatly improved sampling and greatly reduced statistical uncertainties in estimated thermodynamic averages and kinetic rates.">

        <tr id="Numerical approximation methods for the Koopman operator have advanced considerably in the last few years. In particular, data-driven approaches such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)51 and its generalization, the extended-DMD (EDMD), are becoming increasingly popular in practical applications. The EDMD improves upon the classical DMD by the inclusion of a flexible choice of dictionary of observables which spans a finite dimensional subspace on which the Koopman operator can be approximated. This enhances the accuracy of the solution reconstruction and broadens the applicability of the Koopman formalism. Although the convergence of the EDMD has been established, applying the method in practice requires a careful choice of the observables to improve convergence with just a finite number of terms. This is especially difficult for high dimensional and highly nonlinear systems. In this paper, we employ ideas from machine learning to improve upon the EDMD method. We develop an iterative approximation algorithm which couples the EDMD with a trainable dictionary represented by an artificial neural network. Using the Duffing oscillator and the Kuramoto Sivashinsky partical differential equation as examples, we show that our algorithm can effectively and efficiently adapt the trainable dictionary to the problem at hand to achieve good reconstruction accuracy without the need to choose a fixed dictionary a priori. Furthermore, to obtain a given accuracy, we require fewer dictionary terms than EDMD with fixed dictionaries. This alleviates an important shortcoming of the EDMD algorithm and enhances the applicability of the Koopman framework to practical problems.">

        <tr id="The success of enhanced sampling molecular simulations that accelerate along collective variables (CVs) is predicated on the availability of variables coincident with the slow collective motions governing the long-time conformational dynamics of a system. It is challenging to intuit these slow CVs for all but the simplest molecular systems, and their data-driven discovery directly from molecular simulation trajectories has been a central focus of the molecular simulation community to both unveil the important physical mechanisms and drive enhanced sampling. In this work, we introduce state-free reversible VAMPnets (SRV) as a deep learning architecture that learns nonlinear CV approximants to the leading slow eigenfunctions of the spectral decomposition of the transfer operator that evolves equilibrium-scaled probability distributions through time. Orthogonality of the learned CVs is naturally imposed within network training without added regularization. The CVs are inherently explicit and differentiable functions of the input coordinates making them well-suited to use in enhanced sampling calculations. We demonstrate the utility of SRVs in capturing parsimonious nonlinear representations of complex system dynamics in applications to 1D and 2D toy systems where the true eigenfunctions are exactly calculable and to molecular dynamics simulations of alanine dipeptide and the WW domain protein.">

        <tr id="We investigate learning the eigenfunctions of evolution operators for time-reversal invariant stochastic processes, a prime example being the Langevin equation used in molecular dynamics. Many physical or chemical processes described by this equation involve transitions between metastable states separated by high potential barriers that can hardly be crossed during a simulation. To overcome this bottleneck, data are collected via biased simulations that explore the state space more rapidly. We propose a framework for learning from biased simulations rooted in the infinitesimal generator of the process and the associated resolvent operator. We contrast our approach to more common ones based on the transfer operator, showing that it can provably learn the spectral properties of the unbiased system from biased data. In experiments, we highlight the advantages of our method over transfer operator approaches and recent developments based on generator learning, demonstrating its effectiveness in estimating eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. Importantly, we show that even with datasets containing only a few relevant transitions due to sub-optimal biasing, our approach recovers relevant information about the transition mechanism.">

        <tr id="Markov state models (MSMs) have proven valuable in studying the dynamics of protein conformational changes via statistical analysis of molecular dynamics simulations. In MSMs, the complex configuration space is coarse-grained into conformational states, with dynamics modeled by a series of Markovian transitions among these states at discrete lag times. Constructing the Markovian model at a specific lag time necessitates defining states that circumvent significant internal energy barriers, enabling internal dynamics relaxation within the lag time. This process effectively coarse-grains time and space, integrating out rapid motions within metastable states. Thus, MSMs possess a multiresolution nature, where the granularity of states can be adjusted according to the time-resolution, offering flexibility in capturing system dynamics. This work introduces a continuous embedding approach for molecular conformations using the state predictive information bottleneck (SPIB), a framework that unifies dimensionality reduction and state space partitioning via a continuous, machine learned basis set. Without explicit optimization of the VAMP-based scores, SPIB demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in identifying slow dynamical processes and constructing predictive multiresolution Markovian models. Through applications to well-validated mini-proteins, SPIB showcases unique advantages compared to competing methods. It autonomously and self-consistently adjusts the number of metastable states based on a specified minimal time resolution, eliminating the need for manual tuning. While maintaining efficacy in dynamical properties, SPIB excels in accurately distinguishing metastable states and capturing numerous well-populated macrostates. This contrasts with existing VAMP-based methods, which often emphasize slow dynamics at the expense of incorporating numerous sparsely populated states. Furthermore, SPIB's ability to learn a low-dimensional continuous embedding of the underlying MSMs enhances the interpretation of dynamic pathways. With these benefits, we propose SPIB as an easy-to-implement methodology for end-to-end MSM construction.">

Denoising score matching -- the technology behind the widely popular diffusion models -- has simultaneously emerged as a machine-learning framework for creating samples from noise. Models in the first category are often trained using atomistic forces, while those in the second category extract the data distribution by reverting noise-based corruption. We unify these approaches to improve the training of MLCG force-fields, reducing data requirements by a factor of 100 while maintaining advantages typical to force-based parameterization.

As DMD methods work well in several situations but perform poorly in others, a clarification of the assumptions under which DMD is applicable is desirable. Upon closer inspection, existing interpretations of DMD methods based on the Koopman operator are not quite satisfactory: they justify DMD under assumptions that hold only with probability zero for generic observables. Here, we give a justification for DMD as a local, leading-order reduced model for the dominant system dynamics under conditions that hold with probability one for generic observables and non-degenerate observational data. We achieve this for autonomous and for periodically forced systems of finite or infinite dimensions by constructing linearizing transformations for their dominant dynamics within attracting slow spectral submanifolds (SSMs). Our arguments also lead to a new algorithm, data-driven linearization (DDL), which is a higher-order, systematic linearization of the observable dynamics within slow SSMs. We show by examples how DDL outperforms DMD and EDMD on numerical and experimental data.">

More recent data-driven techniques use neural networks to enable nonlinear projections. Whilst those often enable stronger compression, they may have redundant parameters and lead to suboptimal latent dimensionality. To overcome these, we propose a multistep algorithm that induces sparsity in the encoder-decoder networks for effective reduction in the number of parameters and additional compression of the latent space. This algorithm starts with sparsely initialized a network and training it using linearized Bregman iterations. These iterations have been very successful in computer vision and compressed sensing tasks, but have not yet been used for reduced-order modelling. After the training, we further compress the latent space dimensionality by using a form of proper orthogonal decomposition. Last, we use a bias propagation technique to change the induced sparsity into an effective reduction of parameters. We apply this algorithm to three representative PDE models: 1D diffusion, 1D advection, and 2D reaction-diffusion. Compared to conventional training methods like Adam, the proposed method achieves similar accuracy with 30% less parameters and a significantly smaller latent space.">

        <tr id="Dynamical systems provide a comprehensive way to study complex and changing behaviors across various sciences. Many modern systems are too complicated to analyze directly or we do not have access to models, driving significant interest in learning methods. Koopman operators have emerged as a dominant approach because they allow the study of nonlinear dynamics using linear techniques by solving an infinite-dimensional spectral problem. However, current algorithms face challenges such as lack of convergence, hindering practical progress. This paper addresses a fundamental open question: \textit{When can we robustly learn the spectral properties of Koopman operators from trajectory data of dynamical systems, and when can we not?} Understanding these boundaries is crucial for analysis, applications, and designing algorithms. We establish a foundational approach that combines computational analysis and ergodic theory, revealing the first fundamental barriers -- universal for any algorithm -- associated with system geometry and complexity, regardless of data quality and quantity. For instance, we demonstrate well-behaved smooth dynamical systems on tori where non-trivial eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator cannot be determined by any sequence of (even randomized) algorithms, even with unlimited training data. Additionally, we identify when learning is possible and introduce optimal algorithms with verification that overcome issues in standard methods. These results pave the way for a sharp classification theory of data-driven dynamical systems based on how many limits are needed to solve a problem. These limits characterize all previous methods, presenting a unified view. Our framework systematically determines when and how Koopman spectral properties can be learned.">

KANs were found to be superior in nearly all aspects of training; learning 31 times faster, being 15 times more parameter efficiency, and predicting 1.25 times more accurately as compared to the MLP Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in the case of the 2BP.

Most applications of TPT either focus on systems with modestly sized state spaces or use collective variables to try to tame the curse of dimensionality. Increasingly, expressive function approximators like neural networks and tensor networks have shown promise in computing the central object of TPT, the committor function, even in very high dimensional systems. That progress prompts our consideration of how one could use such a high dimensional function to extract mechanistic insight. Here, we present and illustrate a straightforward but powerful way to track how individual dynamical coordinates evolve during a reactive event. The strategy, which involves marginalizing the reactive ensemble, naturally captures the evolution of the dynamical coordinate's distribution, not just its mean reactive behavior.">

        <tr id="This paper presents a sequence of two approaches for the data-driven control-oriented modeling of networked systems, i.e., the systems that involve many interacting dynamical components. First, a novel deep learning approach named the weak Latent Dynamics Model (wLDM) is developed for learning generic nonlinear dynamics with control. Leveraging the weak form, the wLDM enables more numerically stable and computationally efficient training as well as more accurate prediction, when compared to conventional methods such as neural ordinary differential equations. Building upon the wLDM framework, we propose the weak Graph Koopman Bilinear Form (wGKBF) model, which integrates geometric deep learning and Koopman theory to learn latent space dynamics for networked systems, especially for the challenging cases having multiple timescales. The effectiveness of the wLDM framework and wGKBF model are demonstrated on three example systems of increasing complexity - a controlled double pendulum, the stiff Brusselator dynamics, and an electrified aircraft energy system. These numerical examples show that the wLDM and wGKBF achieve superior predictive accuracy and training efficiency as compared to baseline models. Parametric studies provide insights into the effects of hyperparameters in the weak form. The proposed framework shows the capability to efficiently capture control-dependent dynamics in these systems, including stiff dynamics and multi-physics interactions, offering a promising direction for learning control-oriented models of complex networked systems.">

To bridge this gap, various enhanced sampling techniques have been developed, which are complemented by reweighting techniques to recover the unbiased dynamics. Girsanov reweighting is a reweighting technique that reweights simulation paths, generated by a stochastic MD integrator, without evoking an effective model of the dynamics. Instead, it calculates the relative path probability density at the time resolution of the MD integrator. Efficient implementation of Girsanov reweighting requires that the reweighting factors are calculated on-the-fly during the simulations and thus needs to be implemented within the MD integrator. Here, we present a comprehensive guide for implementing Girsanov reweighting into MD simulations. We demonstrate the implementation in the MD simulation package OpenMM by extending the library openmmtools.

However, their implementation necessitates optimizing a high-dimensional space of parameters and hyperparameters. This fact, along with the requirement of substantial computational resources, poses a barrier to achieving high numerical accuracy. Here, inpsired by DeepONets and to address the above challenges, we present Random Projection-based Operator Networks (RandONets): shallow networks with random projections that learn linear and nonlinear operators. The implementation of RandONets involves: (a) incorporating random bases, thus enabling the use of shallow neural networks with a single hidden layer, where the only unknowns are the output weights of the network's weighted inner product; this reduces dramatically the dimensionality of the parameter space; and, based on this, (b) using established least-squares solvers (e.g., Tikhonov regularization and preconditioned QR decomposition) that offer superior numerical approximation properties compared to other optimization techniques used in deep-learning. In this work, we prove the universal approximation accuracy of RandONets for approximating nonlinear operators and demonstrate their efficiency in approximating linear nonlinear evolution operators (right-hand-sides (RHS)) with a focus on PDEs. We show, that for this particular task, RandONets outperform, both in terms of numerical approximation accuracy and computational cost, the ``vanilla"DeepOnets.">

To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the R\"ossler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.">

In this paper first an unsupervised deep learning-based model, termed Internal Coordinate Net (ICoN), is developed that learns the physical principles of conformational changes from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. Second, interpolating data points in the learned latent space are selected that rapidly identify novel synthetic conformations with sophisticated and large-scale sidechains and backbone arrangements. Third, with the highly dynamic amyloid-β1–42 (Aβ42) monomer, our deep learning model provided a comprehensive sampling of Aβ42’s conformational landscape. Analysis of these synthetic conformations revealed conformational clusters that can be used to rationalize experimental findings. Additionally, the method can identify novel conformations with important interactions in atomistic details that are not included in the training data. New synthetic conformations showed distinct sidechain rearrangements that are probed by our EPR and amino acid substitution studies. The proposed approach is highly transferable and can be used for any available data for training.

They provide critical atomic-level insights into key dynamical events experiments cannot easily capture. However, their impact often falls short as the timescales of the important processes are inaccessible using standard molecular dynamics. Enhanced sampling methods provided avenues to access such crucial rare events, for example key slow conformational changes of biomolecules. However, the bias in enhanced sampling simulations is rarely optimized, and even if they are, the optimization criteria is based on the thermodynamics or Hamiltonian of the system, but do not directly consider molecular kinetics. Here, we introduce a novel enhanced sampling algorithm that adaptively optimizes the bias based on the kinetics of the system for the first time. We identify the optimal bias that minimizes a key physical observable, the mean first passage time (MFPT) from a starting state to a target state. Our algorithm makes use of the relation between biased and unbiased kinetics obtained from discretized Markov state models (MSMs), as established in the dynamic histogram analysis method (DHAM). We demonstrate the applicability of the method for different 1D and 2D analytical potential-based model examples, NaCl dissociation in explicit water, and phosphate unbinding in Ras GTPase. Our algorithm has excellent performance compared with state-of-art enhanced sampling methods in terms of the timescales required to reach the final state in the benchmarking systems. Our findings provide a novel, kinetics-driven enhanced sampling strategy, signatured by a targeted approach to facilitate mapping rare events, with the potential for breakthrough applications in drug discovery and materials science.">

        <tr id="The quasipotential function allows for comprehension and prediction of the escape mechanisms from metastable states in nonlinear dynamical systems. This function acts as a natural extension of the potential function for non-gradient systems and it unveils important properties such as the maximum likelihood transition paths, transition rates and expected exit times of the system. Here, we leverage on machine learning via the combination of two data-driven techniques, namely a neural network and a sparse regression algorithm, to obtain symbolic expressions of quasipotential functions. The key idea is first to determine an orthogonal decomposition of the vector field that governs the underlying dynamics using neural networks, then to interpret symbolically the downhill and circulatory components of the decomposition. These functions are regressed simultaneously with the addition of mathematical constraints. We show that our approach discovers a parsimonious quasipotential equation for an archetypal model with a known exact quasipotential and for the dynamics of a nanomechanical resonator. The analytical forms deliver direct access to the stability of the metastable states and predict rare events with significant computational advantages. Our data-driven approach is of interest for a wide range of applications in which to assess the fluctuating dynamics.">

This architecture is highly flexible, allowing the evaluation of the solution field at any location within the desired domain. However, it imposes a strict constraint on the input space, requiring all input functions to be discretized at the same locations; this limits its practical applications. In this work, we introduce a Resolution Independent Neural Operator (RINO) that provides a framework to make DeepONet resolution-independent, enabling it to handle input functions that are arbitrarily, but sufficiently finely, discretized. To this end, we propose a dictionary learning algorithm to adaptively learn a set of appropriate continuous basis functions, parameterized as implicit neural representations (INRs), from the input data. These basis functions are then used to project arbitrary input function data as a point cloud onto an embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions) with dimensionality equal to the dictionary size, which can be directly used by DeepONet without any architectural changes. In particular, we utilize sinusoidal representation networks (SIRENs) as our trainable INR basis functions. We demonstrate the robustness and applicability of RINO in handling arbitrarily (but sufficiently richly) sampled input functions during both training and inference through several numerical examples.">

Machine learning (ML) based surrogate models have emerged as a promising tool for non-invasive charged particle beam diagnostics.

In this work, we have proposed a temporally structured variational autoencoder model to autoregressively forecast the spatiotemporal dynamics of the 15 unique 2D projections of 6D phase space of charged particle beam as it travels through the LANSCE linear accelerator. In the model, VAE embeds the phase space projections into a lower dimensional latent space. A long-short-term memory network then learns the temporal correlations in the latent space.

We apply this approach to the challenging case of structural transitions in nanoclusters, managing to characterize and explore the structural complexity of an experimentally relevant system constituted by 147 gold atoms. Our inherent-structure variables are shown to be effective at computing complex free-energy landscapes, transition rates, and at describing non-equilibrium melting and freezing processes.

        <tr id="Markov jump processes are continuous-time stochastic processes which describe dynamical systems evolving in discrete state spaces. These processes find wide application in the natural sciences and machine learning, but their inference is known to be far from trivial. In this work we introduce a methodology for zero-shot inference of Markov jump processes (MJPs), on bounded state spaces, from noisy and sparse observations, which consists of two components. First, a broad probability distribution over families of MJPs, as well as over possible observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we simulate a synthetic dataset of hidden MJPs and their noisy observation process. Second, a neural network model that processes subsets of the simulated observations, and that is trained to output the initial condition and rate matrix of the target MJP in a supervised way. We empirically demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) model can infer, in a zero-shot fashion, hidden MJPs evolving in state spaces of different dimensionalities. Specifically, we infer MJPs which describe (i) discrete flashing ratchet systems, which are a type of Brownian motors, and the conformational dynamics in (ii) molecular simulations, (iii) experimental ion channel data and (iv) simple protein folding models. What is more, we show that our model performs on par with state-of-the-art models which are finetuned to the target datasets.">

        <tr id="Diffusion models (DMs) are a class of generative machine learning methods that sample a target distribution by transforming samples of a trivial (often Gaussian) distribution using a learned stochastic differential equation. In standard DMs, this is done by learning a ``score function'' that reverses the effect of adding diffusive noise to the distribution of interest. Here we consider the generalisation of DMs to lattice systems with discrete degrees of freedom, and where noise is added via Markov chain jump dynamics. We show how to use tensor networks (TNs) to efficiently define and sample such ``discrete diffusion models'' (DDMs) without explicitly having to solve a stochastic differential equation. We show the following: (i) by parametrising the data and evolution operators as TNs, the denoising dynamics can be represented exactly; (ii) the auto-regressive nature of TNs allows to generate samples efficiently and without bias; (iii) for sampling Boltzmann-like distributions, TNs allow to construct an efficient learning scheme that integrates well with Monte Carlo. We illustrate this approach to study the equilibrium of two models with non-trivial thermodynamics, the $d=1$ constrained Fredkin chain and the $d=2$ Ising model.">

However, many of the tools for identifying these low-dimensional subspaces are correlational and provide limited insight into the underlying dynamics. The ability to precisely control this latent activity would allow researchers to investigate the structure and function of neural manifolds. Employing techniques from the field of optimal control, we simulate controlling the latent dynamics of a neural population using closed-loop, dynamically generated sensory inputs. Using a spiking neural network (SNN) as a model of a neural circuit, we find low-dimensional representations of both the network activity (the neural manifold) and a set of salient visual stimuli. With a data-driven latent dynamics model, we apply model predictive control (MPC) to provide anticipatory, optimal control over the trajectory of the circuit in a latent space. We are able to control the latent dynamics of the SNN to follow several reference trajectories despite observing only a subset of neurons and with a substantial amount of unknown noise injected into the network. These results provide a framework to experimentally test for causal relationships between manifold dynamics and other variables of interest such as organismal behavior and BCI performance.">

This is a major shortcoming, as most dynamic properties of interest are asymptotic properties such as an attractor or invariant measure. One of the major theoretical challenges for numerical methods is that approximating the dynamical law may not be sufficient to approximate these asymptotic properties. This article presents a method of representing a discrete-time deterministic dynamical system as a Markov process. The procedure is completely data-driven. The technique is proved to be convergent -- the stationary density of the Markov process has a support that converges to the targeted invariant set. Thus invariant sets of arbitrary dynamical systems, even with complicated non-smooth topology, can be approximated by this technique. Under further assumptions of stochastic stability of the targeted system, the technique is also shown to provide a convergent statistical approximation.">

It has been observed that DNNs are particularly well suited to weakening the effect of the curse of dimensionality, a term coined by Richard E. Bellman in the late `50s to describe challenges such as the exponential dependence of the sample complexity, i.e., the number of samples required to solve an approximation problem, on the dimension of the ambient space. However, although DNNs have been used to solve PDEs since the `90s, the literature underpinning their mathematical efficiency in terms of numerical analysis (i.e., stability, accuracy, and sample complexity), is only recently beginning to emerge. In this paper, we leverage recent advancements in function approximation using sparsity-based techniques and random sampling to develop and analyze an efficient high-dimensional PDE solver based on DL. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that it can compete with a novel stable and accurate compressive spectral collocation method. In particular, we demonstrate a new practical existence theorem, which establishes the existence of a class of trainable DNNs with suitable bounds on the network architecture and a sufficient condition on the sample complexity, with logarithmic or, at worst, linear scaling in dimension, such that the resulting networks stably and accurately approximate a diffusion-reaction PDE with high probability.">

We analyze the origin of such instabilities when learning linear dynamical systems, focusing on the training dynamics. We make several analytical findings which empirical observations suggest extend to nonlinear dynamical systems. First, the rate of convergence of the training dynamics is uneven and depends on the distribution of energy in the data. As a special case, the dynamics in directions where the data have no energy cannot be learned. Second, in the unlearnable directions, the dynamics produced by the neural network depend on the weight initialization, and common weight initialization schemes can produce unstable dynamics. Third, injecting synthetic noise into the data during training adds damping to the training dynamics and can stabilize the learned simulator, though doing so undesirably biases the learned dynamics. For each contributor to instability, we suggest mitigative strategies. We also highlight important differences between learning discrete-time and continuous-time dynamics, and discuss extensions to nonlinear systems.">

        <tr id="Large-scale recordings of neural activity over broad anatomical areas with high spatial and temporal resolution are increasingly common in modern experimental neuroscience. Recently, recurrent switching dynamical systems have been used to tackle the scale and complexity of these data. However, an important challenge remains in providing insights into the existence and structure of recurrent linear dynamics in neural time series data. Here we test a scalable approach to time-varying autoregression with low-rank tensors to recover the recurrent dynamics in stochastic neural mass models with multiple stable attractors. We demonstrate that the sparse representation of time-varying system matrices in terms of temporal modes can recover the attractor structure of simple systems via clustering. We then consider simulations based on a human brain connectivity matrix in high and low global connection strength regimes, and reveal the hierarchical clustering structure of the dynamics. Finally, we explain the impact of the forecast time delay on the estimation of the underlying rank and temporal variability of the time series dynamics. This study illustrates that prediction error minimization is not sufficient to recover meaningful dynamic structure and that it is crucial to account for the three key timescales arising from dynamics, noise processes, and attractor switching.">

Previous work on disentangled representation learning within the realm of dynamical systems focused on the latent states, possibly with linear transition approximations. As such, they cannot identify nonlinear transition dynamics, and hence fail to reliably predict complex future behavior. Inspired by the advances in nonlinear ICA, we propose a state-space modeling framework in which we can identify not just the latent states but also the unknown transition function that maps the past states to the present. We introduce a practical algorithm based on variational auto-encoders and empirically demonstrate in realistic synthetic settings that we can (i) recover latent state dynamics with high accuracy, (ii) correspondingly achieve high future prediction accuracy, and (iii) adapt fast to new environments.">

What makes this challenge even harder to solve is that, usually, the object has not been observed previously, and the only information that we can get from it is a stream of RGB camera data. In this study, we explore the use of deep learning techniques to solve this nonlinear identification problem. We specifically focus on extracting dynamic models of simple deformable objects from the high-dimensional sensor input coming from an RGB camera. We investigate a two-stage approach to achieve this goal. First, we train a variational autoencoder to extract an extremely low-dimensional representation of the object configuration. Then, we learn a dynamic model that predicts the evolution of these latent space variables. The proposed architecture can accurately predict the object's state up to one second into the future.">

Therefore, developing reduced dimensionality representations that encapsulate complex correlation effects in many-body systems is crucial to advance the understanding of these complicated problems. However, a numerical evaluation of these predictive models can still be associated with a significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, in this paper, we discuss a combined framework that integrates recent advances in the development of active-space representations of coupled cluster (CC) downfolded Hamiltonians with neural network approaches. The primary objective of this effort is to train neural networks to eliminate the computationally expensive steps required for evaluating hundreds or thousands of Hugenholtz diagrams, which correspond to multidimensional tensor contractions necessary for evaluating a many-body form of downfolded/effective Hamiltonians. Using small molecular systems (the H2O and HF molecules) as examples, we demonstrate that training neural networks employing effective Hamiltonians for a few nuclear geometries of molecules can accurately interpolate/ extrapolate their forms to other geometrical configurations characterized by different intensities of correlation effects. We also discuss differences between effective interactions that define CC downfolded Hamiltonians with those of bare Hamiltonians defined by Coulomb interactions in the active spaces.">

NEIM is a greedy algorithm which accomplishes this reduction by approximating an affine decomposition of the nonlinear term of the ROM, where the vector terms of the expansion are given by neural networks depending on the ROM solution, and the coefficients are given by an interpolation of some"optimal"coefficients. Because NEIM is based on a greedy strategy, we are able to provide a basic error analysis to investigate its performance. NEIM has the advantages of being easy to implement in models with automatic differentiation, of being a nonlinear projection of the ROM nonlinearity, of being efficient for both nonlocal and local nonlinearities, and of relying solely on data and not the explicit form of the ROM nonlinearity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology on solution-dependent and solution-independent nonlinearities, a nonlinear elliptic problem, and a nonlinear parabolic model of liquid crystals.">

Our approach uses a smoother based on iterating a conditional particle filter with ancestral sampling to first generate plausible trajectories matching observed marginals, and learns the corresponding diffusion model. This approach provides both a generative method for high-quality, smoothed trajectories under complex constraints, and an efficient approximation of the particle smoothing distribution for classical tracking problems.

While latent variable models can successfully extract low-dimensional embeddings from such recordings, using them to generate realistic spiking data, especially in a behavior-dependent manner, still poses a challenge. Here, we present Latent Diffusion for Neural Spiking data (LDNS), a diffusion-based generative model with a low-dimensional latent space: LDNS employs an autoencoder with structured state-space (S4) layers to project discrete high-dimensional spiking data into continuous time-aligned latents. On these inferred latents, we train expressive (conditional) diffusion models, enabling us to sample neural activity with realistic single-neuron and population spiking statistics. We validate LDNS on synthetic data, accurately recovering latent structure, firing rates, and spiking statistics. Next, we demonstrate its flexibility by generating variable-length data that mimics human cortical activity during attempted speech. We show how to equip LDNS with an expressive observation model that accounts for single-neuron dynamics not mediated by the latent state, further increasing the realism of generated samples. Finally, conditional LDNS trained on motor cortical activity during diverse reaching behaviors can generate realistic spiking data given reach direction or unseen reach trajectories. In summary, LDNS simultaneously enables inference of low-dimensional latents and realistic conditional generation of neural spiking datasets, opening up further possibilities for simulating experimentally testable hypotheses.">

However, it is unclear how to best fit low-rank RNNs to data consisting of noisy observations of an underlying stochastic system. Here, we propose to fit stochastic low-rank RNNs with variational sequential Monte Carlo methods. We validate our method on several datasets consisting of both continuous and spiking neural data, where we obtain lower dimensional latent dynamics than current state of the art methods. Additionally, for low-rank models with piecewise linear nonlinearities, we show how to efficiently identify all fixed points in polynomial rather than exponential cost in the number of units, making analysis of the inferred dynamics tractable for large RNNs.

The method is based on the assumption that the observed sequences arise from a common domain, but each sequence obeys its own autoregressive models that are related to each other through low-rank regularization. We cast the problem as a computationally efficient convex matrix parameter recovery problem using monotone Variational Inequality and encode the common domain assumption via low-rank constraint across the learned representations, which can learn the geometry for the entire domain as well as faithful representations for the dynamics of each individual sequence using the domain information in totality.

New neural network architectures are proposed to effectively learn the key dynamical mechanisms including the multiscale coupling and strong instability, and gain robust skill for long-time prediction resistive to the accumulated model errors from the data-driven approximation. The machine learning model overcomes the inherent limitations in traditional long short-time memory networks by exploiting a conditional Gaussian structure informed of the essential physical dynamics. The model performance is demonstrated under a prototype model from idealized geophysical flow and passive tracers, which exhibits analytical solutions with representative statistical features. Many attractive properties are found in the trained model in recovering the hidden dynamics using a limited dataset and sparse observation time, showing uniformly high skill with persistent numerical stability in predicting both the trajectory and statistical solutions among different statistical regimes away from the training regime. The model framework is promising to be applied to a wider class of turbulent systems with complex structures.">

        <tr id="Recently, machine learning potentials (MLP) largely enhances the reliability of molecular dynamics, but its accuracy is limited by the underlying $\textit{ab initio}$ methods. A viable approach to overcome this limitation is to refine the potential by learning from experimental data, which now can be done efficiently using modern automatic differentiation technique. However, potential refinement is mostly performed using thermodynamic properties, leaving the most accessible and informative dynamical data (like spectroscopy) unexploited. In this work, through a comprehensive application of adjoint and gradient truncation methods, we show that both memory and gradient explosion issues can be circumvented in many situations, so the dynamical property differentiation is well-behaved. Consequently, both transport coefficients and spectroscopic data can be used to improve the density functional theory based MLP towards higher accuracy. Essentially, this work contributes to the solution of the inverse problem of spectroscopy by extracting microscopic interactions from vibrational spectroscopic data.">

        <tr id="Using equilibrium fluctuations to understand the response of a physical system to an externally imposed perturbation is the basis for linear response theory, which is widely used to interpret experiments and shed light on microscopic dynamics. For nonequilibrium systems, perturbations cannot be interpreted simply by monitoring fluctuations in a conjugate observable -- additional dynamical information is needed. The theory of linear response around nonequilibrium steady states relies on path ensemble averaging, which makes this theory inapplicable to perturbations that affect the diffusion constant or temperature in a stochastic system. Here, we show that a separate, ``effective'' physical process can be used to describe the perturbed dynamics and that this dynamics in turn allows us to accurately calculate the response to a change in the diffusion. Interestingly, the effective dynamics contains an additional drift that is proportional to the ``score'' of the instantaneous probability density of the system -- this object has also been studied extensively in recent years in the context of denoising diffusion models in the machine learning literature. Exploiting recently developed algorithms for learning the score, we show that we can carry out nonequilibrium response calculations on systems for which the exact score cannot be obtained.">

In this work, we tackle it through a principled unified framework using deterministic or stochastic evolutions described by partial differential equations (PDEs). This framework incorporates prior trajectory-based sampling methods, such as diffusion models or Schr\"odinger bridges, without relying on the concept of time-reversals. Moreover, it allows us to propose novel numerical methods for solving the transport task and thus sampling from complicated targets without the need for the normalization constant or data samples. We employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate the respective PDE solutions, implying both conceptional and computational advantages. In particular, PINNs allow for simulation- and discretization-free optimization and can be trained very efficiently, leading to significantly better mode coverage in the sampling task compared to alternative methods. Moreover, they can readily be fine-tuned with Gauss-Newton methods to achieve high accuracy in sampling.">

        <tr id="Laplace approximations are popular techniques for endowing deep networks with epistemic uncertainty estimates as they can be applied without altering the predictions of the neural network, and they scale to large models and datasets. While the choice of prior strongly affects the resulting posterior distribution, computational tractability and lack of interpretability of weight space typically limit the Laplace approximation to isotropic Gaussian priors, which are known to cause pathological behavior as depth increases. As a remedy, we directly place a prior on function space. More precisely, since Lebesgue densities do not exist on infinite-dimensional function spaces, we have to recast training as finding the so-called weak mode of the posterior measure under a Gaussian process (GP) prior restricted to the space of functions representable by the neural network. Through the GP prior, one can express structured and interpretable inductive biases, such as regularity or periodicity, directly in function space, while still exploiting the implicit inductive biases that allow deep networks to generalize. After model linearization, the training objective induces a negative log-posterior density to which we apply a Laplace approximation, leveraging highly scalable methods from matrix-free linear algebra. Our method provides improved results where prior knowledge is abundant, e.g., in many scientific inference tasks. At the same time, it stays competitive for black-box regression and classification tasks where neural networks typically excel.">

First, high-dimensional training data samples will be mapped to a low-dimensional feature space through the principal component analysis (PCA) featuring process. Following that, the feature space is bisected into multiple partitions based on the variation of the Shannon entropy under the maximum entropy (ME) bisecting process. The behavior of subsystems in the prespecified state space partitions will then be approximated using a group of shallow neural networks (SNNs) known as extreme learning machines (ELMs), and then it can further simplify the model by merging the redundant lattices based on their training error performance. The proposed modeling framework can handle high-dimensional dynamical system modeling problems with the advantages of reducing model complexity and improving model performance in training and verification. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling framework, examples of modeling the LASA dataset and an industrial robot are presented.">

Our study focuses on examining the generalization error as a component of the total error in the DBDP framework, discovering that the rate of convergence for the generalization error is influenced by the choice of sampling methods. Specifically, for a given batch size $m$, the generalization error under QMC methods exhibits a convergence rate of $O(m^{-1+\varepsilon})$, where $\varepsilon$ can be made arbitrarily small. This rate is notably more favorable than that of the traditional Monte Carlo (MC) methods, which is $O(m^{-1/2+\varepsilon})$. Our theoretical analysis shows that the generalization error under QMC methods achieves a higher order of convergence than their MC counterparts. Numerical experiments demonstrate that QMC indeed surpasses MC in delivering solutions that are both more precise and stable.">

Yet, current frameworks are limited by assuming a single Markov chain describes the data, and they suffer an inability to discern heterogeneities. As a solution, this paper proposes a variational expectation-maximization algorithm that identifies a mixture of Markov chains in a time-series data set. The method is agnostic to the definition of the Markov states, whether data-driven (e.g. by spectral clustering) or based on domain knowledge. Variational EM efficiently and organically identifies the number of Markov chains and dynamics of each chain without expensive model comparisons or posterior sampling. The approach is supported by a theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, including simulated and observational data sets based on ${\tt Last.fm}$ music listening, ultramarathon running, and gene expression. The results show the new algorithm is competitive with contemporary mixture modeling approaches and powerful in identifying meaningful heterogeneities in time series data.">

However, in this perspective, we argue that a more successful approach is a proper combination of these two methodologies. We discuss how ideas coming from physical modeling neuronal processing led to early formulations of computational neural networks, e.g., Hopfield networks. We then show how modern learning approaches like Potts models, Boltzmann machines, and the transformer architecture are related to each other, specifically, through a shared energy representation. We summarize recent efforts to establish these connections and provide examples on how each of these formulations integrating physical modeling and machine learning have been successful in tackling recent problems in biomolecular structure, dynamics, function, evolution, and design. Instances include protein structure prediction; improvement in computational complexity and accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations; better inference of the effects of mutations in proteins leading to improved evolutionary modeling and finally how machine learning is revolutionizing protein engineering and design. Going beyond naturally existing protein sequences, a connection to protein design is discussed where synthetic sequences are able to fold to naturally occurring motifs driven by a model rooted in physical principles. We show that this model is “learnable” and propose its future use in the generation of unique sequences that can fold into a target structure.">

To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we focus on next-generation reservoir computing (NGRC) -- a popular framework for learning dynamics from data. We find that, despite learning a better representation of the flow map with more training data, NGRC can adopt an ill-conditioned ``integrator'' and lose stability. We link this data-induced instability to the auxiliary dimensions created by the delayed states in NGRC. Based on these findings, we propose simple strategies to mitigate the instability, either by increasing regularization strength in tandem with data size, or by carefully introducing noise during training.

        <tr id="Coarse-graining is a molecular modeling technique in which an atomistic system is represented in a simplified fashion that retains the most significant system features that contribute to a target output, while removing the degrees of freedom that are less relevant. This reduction in model complexity allows coarse-grained molecular simulations to reach increased spatial and temporal scales compared to corresponding all-atom models. A core challenge in coarse-graining is to construct a force field that represents the interactions in the new representation in a way that preserves the atomistic-level properties. Many approaches to building coarse-grained force fields have limited transferability between different thermodynamic conditions as a result of averaging over internal fluctuations at a specific thermodynamic state point. Here, we use a graph-convolutional neural network architecture, the Hierarchically Interacting Particle Neural Network with Tensor Sensitivity (HIP-NN-TS), to develop a highly automated training pipeline for coarse grained force fields which allows for studying the transferability of coarse-grained models based on the force-matching approach. We show that this approach not only yields highly accurate force fields, but also that these force fields are more transferable through a variety of thermodynamic conditions. These results illustrate the potential of machine learning techniques such as graph neural networks to improve the construction of transferable coarse-grained force fields.">

Four molecular descriptors were considered: radial distribution functions (RDFs), mean square displacements (MSDs), relative square displacements (RSDs), and dihedral angles (DAs). By applying a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to analyze the PCA and DM projections, and by quantifying their log-likelihoods as a density-based metric, a distinct separation into two populations corresponding to melt and glass states was revealed. This separation enabled the $T_\mathrm{g}$ evaluation from a cooling-induced sharp increase in the overlap between log-likelihood distributions at different temperatures. $T_\mathrm{g}$ values derived from the RDF and MSD descriptors using DM closely matched the standard computer simulation-based dilatometric and dynamic $T_\mathrm{g}$ values for both PLA and PHB models. This was not the case for PCA. The DM-transformed DA and RSD data resulted in $T_\mathrm{g}$ values in agreement with experimental ones. Overall, the fusion of atomistic simulations and diffusion maps complemented with the Gaussian Mixture Models presents a promising framework for computing $T_\mathrm{g}$ and studying the glass transition in a unified way across various molecular descriptors for glass-forming materials.">

The optimal prediction is used to analyze dynamical systems in which the states consist of resolved and unresolved variables. The latter variables can not be measured explicitly. They may have smaller amplitudes and affect the resolved variables that can be measured. The optimal prediction approach recovers the averaged trajectories of the resolved variables by computing conditional expectations, while the distribution of the unresolved variables is assumed to be known. We consider such dynamical systems and introduce their additional control functions. To predict the targeted trajectories numerically, we develop a data-driven method based on the dynamic mode decomposition. The proposed approach takes the $\mathit{measured}$ trajectories of the resolved variables, constructs an approximate linear operator from the Mori-Zwanzig decomposition, and reconstructs the $\mathit{averaged}$ trajectories of the same variables. It is demonstrated that the method is much faster than the Monte Carlo simulations and it provides a reliable prediction. We experimentally confirm the efficacy of the proposed method for two Hamiltonian dynamical systems.">

        <tr id="Echo state network (ESN) implements an alternative paradigm called reservoir computing to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs), where internal weights are randomly generated and kept fixed, and only readout weights need to be trained, which greatly reduces the training complexity of RNNs. ESN not only facilitates the practical implementation of RNNs but also shows superior performance over fully trained RNNs across a range of applications. However, the conventional ESN suffers from the drawbacks of stringent conditions for weight convergence and slow convergence speed. This paper proposes a memory regressor extended learning method to update the readout weights of ESNs. By constructing and incorporating a generalized prediction error based on regressor extension and filtering, the capacity of ESN to utilize historical data can be greatly improved. In the discrete-time domain, it is proven that exponential convergence of readout weights is achieved under a condition termed interval excitation that is strictly weaker than the classical condition of persistent excitation. Simulation results on modeling a 10th-order nonlinear autoregressive moving-average (NARMA) system have revealed that the proposed approach accelerates weight convergence speed almost ten times higher compared to the conventional ESN.">

To overcome this challenge, we introduce the flow perturbation method, which incorporates optimized stochastic perturbations into the flow. By reweighting trajectories generated by the perturbed flow, our method achieves unbiased sampling of the Boltzmann distribution with orders of magnitude speedup compared to both brute force Jacobian calculations and the Hutchinson estimator. Notably, it accurately sampled the Chignolin protein with all atomic Cartesian coordinates explicitly represented, which, to our best knowledge, is the largest molecule ever Boltzmann sampled in such detail using generative models.">

However, TI calculations are computationally expensive and typically limited to coupling a small number of degrees of freedom due to the need to sample numerous intermediate ensembles with sufficient conformational-space overlap. In this work, we propose to perform TI along an alchemical pathway represented by a trainable neural network, which we term Neural TI. Critically, we parametrize a time-dependent Hamiltonian interpolating between the interacting and non-interacting systems, and optimize its gradient using a denoising-diffusion objective. The ability of the resulting energy-based diffusion model to sample all intermediate ensembles allows us to perform TI from a single reference calculation. We apply our method to Lennard-Jones fluids, where we report accurate calculations of the excess chemical potential, demonstrating that Neural TI is capable of coupling hundreds of degrees of freedom at once.">

We show that parallel organization facilitates the convergence of the minimization procedure, avoiding the known memory and numerical stability issues of differentiable molecular dynamics approaches. We showcase the effectiveness of our implementation by producing a library of force field parameters for standard phospholipids, with either zwitterionic or anionic heads and with saturated or unsaturated tails. Compared to the all-atom reference, the force field obtained by ∂-HyMD yields better density profiles than the parameters derived from previously utilized gradient-free optimization procedures. Moreover, ∂-HyMD models can predict with good accuracy properties not included in the learning objective, such as lateral pressure profiles, and are transferable to other systems, including triglycerides.">

This method is used to quantify uncertainty in the inverse PDE PINN solutions. Recently, the Bayesian PINN (BPINN) method was proposed, where the posterior distribution of the PINN parameters was formulated using the Bayes' theorem and sampled using approximate inference methods such as the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and variational inference (VI) methods. In this work, we demonstrate that HMC fails to converge for non-linear inverse PDE problems. As an alternative to HMC, we sample the distribution by solving the stochastic optimization problem obtained by randomizing the PINN loss function. The effectiveness of the rPINN method is tested for linear and non-linear Poisson equations, and the diffusion equation with a high-dimensional space-dependent diffusion coefficient. The rPINN method provides informative distributions for all considered problems. For the linear Poisson equation, HMC and rPINN produce similar distributions, but rPINN is on average 27 times faster than HMC. For the non-linear Poison and diffusion equations, the HMC method fails to converge because a single HMC chain cannot sample multiple modes of the posterior distribution of the PINN parameters in a reasonable amount of time.">

Despite existing methods being promising, the key challenge of extending existing methods for broader real-world applications lies in the computational cost at inference time, i.e., sampling from a diffusion model is considerably slow as it often requires tens to hundreds of iterations to generate even one sample. To circumvent this issue, we propose to leverage the flexibility of diffusion models for RL from a representation learning perspective. In particular, by exploiting the connection between diffusion model and energy-based model, we develop Diffusion Spectral Representation (Diff-SR), a coherent algorithm framework that enables extracting sufficient representations for value functions in Markov decision processes (MDP) and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP). We further demonstrate how Diff-SR facilitates efficient policy optimization and practical algorithms while explicitly bypassing the difficulty and inference cost of sampling from the diffusion model. Finally, we provide comprehensive empirical studies to verify the benefits of Diff-SR in delivering robust and advantageous performance across various benchmarks with both fully and partially observable settings.">

Therefore, time-dependent model order reduction techniques such as the dynamical low-rank approximation are desirable. In this paper we propose a dynamical low-rank algorithm for the kinetic CME using binary tree tensor networks. The dimensionality of the problem is reduced in this approach by hierarchically dividing the reaction network into partitions. Only reactions that cross partitions are subject to an approximation error. We demonstrate by two numerical examples (a 5-dimensional lambda phage model and a 20-dimensional reaction cascade) that the proposed method drastically reduces memory consumption and shows improved computational performance and better accuracy compared to a Monte Carlo method.">

This state-space representation, known as the Markovian Gaussian Process (Markovian GP), leverages the flexibility of kernel functions while maintaining efficient linear computation. Unlike existing GP-LDS conversion methods, which require separability for most multi-output kernels, our approach works universally for single- and multi-output stationary temporal kernels. We evaluate our method by computing covariance, performing regression tasks, and applying it to a neuroscience application, demonstrating that our method provides an accurate state-space representation for stationary temporal GPs.">

However, in accordance with the Green's formulation, NGOs accept weighted averages of the input functions, rather than sampled values thereof, as is the case in DeepONets and VarMiONs. Application of NGOs to canonical linear parametric PDEs shows that, while they remain competitive with DeepONets, VarMiONs and Fourier neural operators when testing on data that lie within the training distribution, they robustly generalize when testing on finer-scale data generated outside of the training distribution. Furthermore, we show that the explicit representation of the Green's function that is returned by NGOs enables the construction of effective preconditioners for numerical solvers for PDEs.">

In the absence of labeled datasets, we utilize the PDE residual loss to learn the physical system, an approach known as physics-informed DeepONet. This method faces significant computational challenges, primarily due to the curse of dimensionality, as the computational cost increases exponentially with finer discretization. In this paper, we introduce the Separable DeepONet framework to address these challenges and improve scalability for high-dimensional PDEs. Our approach involves a factorization technique where sub-networks handle individual one-dimensional coordinates, thereby reducing the number of forward passes and the size of the Jacobian matrix. By using forward-mode automatic differentiation, we further optimize the computational cost related to the Jacobian matrix. As a result, our modifications lead to a linear scaling of computational cost with discretization density, making Separable DeepONet suitable for high-dimensional PDEs. We validate the effectiveness of the separable architecture through three benchmark PDE models: the viscous Burgers equation, Biot's consolidation theory, and a parametrized heat equation. In all cases, our proposed framework achieves comparable or improved accuracy while significantly reducing computational time compared to conventional DeepONet.

We show how to embed two existing AD particle filter methods in a theoretical framework that provides an extension to a new class of algorithms. This new class permits a bias/variance tradeoff and hence a mean squared error substantially lower than the existing algorithms. We develop likelihood maximization algorithms suited to the Monte Carlo properties of the AD gradient estimate. Our algorithms require only a differentiable simulator for the latent dynamic system; by contrast, most previous approaches to AD likelihood maximization for particle filters require access to the system's transition probabilities.

As a demonstration, we study the collective emission from multiple emitters coupled to a square lattice of bosons and observe how the departure from Markovianity as coupling strength and emitter number is increased prevents collective radiation. We also simulate the dynamic preparation of an excitation in a bound state from a multi-excitation initial state.

        <tr id="Enhancing the sparsity of data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) has gained increasing attention in recent years. In this work, we analyze an efficient approach to identifying skillful ROMs with a sparse structure using an information-theoretic indicator called causation entropy. The causation entropy quantifies in a statistical way the additional contribution of each term to the underlying dynamics beyond the information already captured by all the other terms in the ansatz. By doing so, the causation entropy assesses the importance of each term to the dynamics before a parameter estimation procedure is performed. Thus, the approach can be utilized to eliminate terms with little dynamic impact, leading to a parsimonious structure that retains the essential physics. To circumvent the difficulty of estimating high-dimensional probability density functions (PDFs) involved in the causation entropy computation, we leverage Gaussian approximations for such PDFs, which are demonstrated to be sufficient even in the presence of highly non-Gaussian dynamics. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation by building sparse causation-based ROMs for various purposes, such as recovering long-term statistics and inferring unobserved dynamics via data assimilation with partial observations.">

In this article, we introduce a class of equivariant representations of tensor-valued functions based on the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) framework that allows for efficient learning of such configuration-dependent friction and diffusion tensors from data. Besides satisfying the correct equivariance properties with respect to the Euclidean group E(3), the resulting heat bath models satisfy a fluctuation-dissipation relation. Moreover, our models can be extended to include additional symmetries, such as momentum conservation, to preserve the hydrodynamic properties of the particle system. We demonstrate the capabilities of the model by constructing a model of configuration-dependent tensorial electronic friction calculated from first principles that arises during reactive molecular dynamics at metal surfaces.">

PANNs combine the strengths of DNNs (flexibility and efficiency in higher-dimensional approximation) with those of polynomial approximation (rapid convergence rates for smooth functions). To aid in both stable training and enhanced accuracy over a variety of problems, we present (1) a family of orthogonality constraints that impose mutual orthogonality between the polynomial and the DNN within a PANN; (2) a simple basis pruning approach to combat the curse of dimensionality introduced by the polynomial component; and (3) an adaptation of a polynomial preconditioning strategy to both DNNs and polynomials.

        <tr id="Modeling dynamical systems, e.g. in climate and engineering sciences, often necessitates solving partial differential equations. Neural operators are deep neural networks designed to learn nontrivial solution operators of such differential equations from data. As for all statistical models, the predictions of these models are imperfect and exhibit errors. Such errors are particularly difficult to spot in the complex nonlinear behaviour of dynamical systems. We introduce a new framework for approximate Bayesian uncertainty quantification in neural operators using function-valued Gaussian processes. Our approach can be interpreted as a probabilistic analogue of the concept of currying from functional programming and provides a practical yet theoretically sound way to apply the linearized Laplace approximation to neural operators. In a case study on Fourier neural operators, we show that, even for a discretized input, our method yields a Gaussian closure--a structured Gaussian process posterior capturing the uncertainty in the output function of the neural operator, which can be evaluated at an arbitrary set of points. The method adds minimal prediction overhead, can be applied post-hoc without retraining the neural operator, and scales to large models and datasets. We showcase the efficacy of our approach through applications to different types of partial differential equations.">

Tuning accelerators can be a time-consuming process involving manual adjustment of multiple components, such as RF cavities, to minimize beam loss due to time-varying drifts. The high dimensionality of the system ($\sim$100 amplitude and phase RF settings in the LANSCE accelerator) makes it difficult to achieve optimal operation. The time-varying drifts and the dimensionality make system parameter estimation a challenging optimization problem. In this work, we propose a Variational Autoencoded Latent Regression (VALeR) model for robust estimation of system parameters using 2D unique projections of a charged particle beam's 6D phase space. In VALeR, VAE projects the phase space projections into a lower-dimensional latent space, and a dense neural network maps the latent space onto the space of system parameters. The trained network can predict system parameters for unseen phase space projections. Furthermore, VALeR can generate new projections by randomly sampling the latent space of VAE and also estimate the corresponding system parameters.">

Our research framework enables us to explore the intricate interplay between kernel methods and optimization processes, shedding light on the optimization dynamics and convergence properties of neural networks. In this study, we establish sharp convergence rates for the last iterate of the SGD algorithm in overparameterized two-layer neural networks. Additionally, we have made significant advancements in relaxing the constraints on the number of neurons, which have been reduced from exponential dependence to polynomial dependence on the sample size or number of iterations. This improvement allows for more flexibility in the design and scaling of neural networks, and will deepen our theoretical understanding of neural network models trained with SGD.">

Indeed, with appropriate scaling, supervised learning in neural networks can result in strong, task-dependent feature learning. However, the nature of the emergent representations, which we call the `coding scheme', is still unclear. To understand the emergent coding scheme, we investigate fully-connected, wide neural networks learning classification tasks using the Bayesian framework where learning shapes the posterior distribution of the network weights. Consistent with previous findings, our analysis of the feature learning regime (also known as `non-lazy', `rich', or `mean-field' regime) shows that the networks acquire strong, data-dependent features. Surprisingly, the nature of the internal representations depends crucially on the neuronal nonlinearity. In linear networks, an analog coding scheme of the task emerges. Despite the strong representations, the mean predictor is identical to the lazy case. In nonlinear networks, spontaneous symmetry breaking leads to either redundant or sparse coding schemes. Our findings highlight how network properties such as scaling of weights and neuronal nonlinearity can profoundly influence the emergent representations.">

Compared to MLPs, KANs offer interpretability and require fewer parameters. PDEs can be described in various forms, such as strong form, energy form, and inverse form. While mathematically equivalent, these forms are not computationally equivalent, making the exploration of different PDE formulations significant in computational physics. Thus, we propose different PDE forms based on KAN instead of MLP, termed Kolmogorov-Arnold-Informed Neural Network (KINN). We systematically compare MLP and KAN in various numerical examples of PDEs, including multi-scale, singularity, stress concentration, nonlinear hyperelasticity, heterogeneous, and complex geometry problems. Our results demonstrate that KINN significantly outperforms MLP in terms of accuracy and convergence speed for numerous PDEs in computational solid mechanics, except for the complex geometry problem. This highlights KINN's potential for more efficient and accurate PDE solutions in AI for PDEs.">

The pseudomode expansion emerges in the framework of the Heisenberg version of the recursion method. This method essentially solves Heisenberg equations in a Lanczos tridiagonal basis constructed in the Krylov space of a given observable. To obtain pseudomodes, we first add artificial dissipation satisfying the dissipative generalization of the universal operator growth hypothesis, and then take the limit of the vanishing dissipation strength. Fast convergence of the pseudomode expansion is facilitated by the localization in the Krylov space, which is generic in the presence of dissipation and can survive the limit of the vanishing dissipation strength. As an illustration, we apply the pseudomode expansion to calculate infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions in the quantum Ising and $XX$ spin-$1/2$ models on the square lattice.">

        <tr id="Proteins are dynamic systems whose structural preferences determine their function. Unfortunately, building atomically detailed models of protein structural ensembles remains challenging, limiting our understanding of the relationships between sequence, structure, and function. Combining single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments with molecular dynamics simulations could provide experimentally grounded, all-atom models of a protein’s structural ensemble. However, agreement between the two techniques is often insufficient to achieve this goal. Here, we explore whether accounting for important experimental details like averaging across structures sampled during a given smFRET measurement is responsible for this apparent discrepancy. We present an approach to account for this time-averaging by leveraging the kinetic information available from Markov state models of a protein’s dynamics. This allows us to accurately assess which timescales are averaged during an experiment. We find this approach significantly improves agreement between simulations and experiments in proteins with varying degrees of dynamics, including the well-ordered protein T4 lysozyme, the partially disordered protein apolipoprotein E (ApoE), and a disordered amyloid protein (Aβ40). We find evidence for hidden states that are not apparent in smFRET experiments because of time averaging with other structures, akin to states in fast exchange in NMR, and evaluate different force fields. Finally, we show how remaining discrepancies between computations and experiments can be used to guide additional simulations and build structural models for states that were previously unaccounted for. We expect our approach will enable combining simulations and experiments to understand the link between sequence, structure, and function in many settings.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of deep operator networks (DeepONets) in solving both forward and inverse problems of partial differential equations (PDEs) on unknown manifolds. By unknown manifolds, we identify the manifold by a set of randomly sampled data point clouds that are assumed to lie on or close to the manifold. When the loss function incorporates the physics, resulting in the so-called physics-informed DeepONets (PI-DeepONets), we approximate the differentiation terms in the PDE by an appropriate operator approximation scheme. For the second-order elliptic PDE with a nontrivial diffusion coefficient, we approximate the differentiation term with one of these methods: the Diffusion Maps (DM), the Radial Basis Functions (RBF), and the Generalized Moving Least Squares (GMLS) methods. For the GMLS approximation, which is more flexible for problems with boundary conditions, we derive the theoretical error bound induced by the approximate differentiation. Numerically, we found that DeepONet is accurate for various types of diffusion coefficients, including linear, exponential, piecewise linear, and quadratic functions, for linear and semi-linear PDEs with/without boundaries. When the number of observations is small, PI-DeepONet trained with sufficiently large samples of PDE constraints produces more accurate approximations than DeepONet. For the inverse problem, we incorporate PI-DeepONet in a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework to estimate the diffusion coefficient from noisy solutions of the PDEs measured at a finite number of point cloud data. Numerically, we found that PI-DeepONet provides accurate approximations comparable to those obtained by a more expensive method that directly solves the PDE on the proposed diffusion coefficient in each MCMC iteration.">

        <tr id="The unfolding of molecular complexes or biomolecules under the influence of external mechanical forces can routinely be simulated with atomistic resolution. To obtain a match of the characteristic time scales with those of experimental force spectroscopy, often coarse graining procedures are employed. Here, building on a previous study, we apply the adaptice resolution scheme (AdResS) to force probe molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations using two model systems as examples. One system is the previously investigated calix[4]arene dimer that shows reversible one-step unfolding and the other example is provided by a small peptide, a $\beta$-alanine octamer in methanol solvent. The mechanical unfolding of this peptide proceeds via a metastable intermediate and therefore represents a first step towards a complex unfolding pathway. In addition to increasing the complexity of the relevant conformational changes we study the impact of the methodology used for coarse graining. Apart from a standard technique, the iterative Boltzmann inversion method, we apply an ideal gas approximation and therefore we replace the solvent by a non-interacting system of spherical particles. In all cases we find excellent agreement between the results of FPMD simulations performed fully atomistically and the AdResS simulations also in the case of fast pulling. This holds for all details of the unfolding pathways like the distributions of the characteristic forces and also the sequence of hydrogen-bond opening in case of the $\beta$-alanine octamer. Therefore, the methodology is very well suited to simulate the mechanical unfolding of systems of experimental relevance also in the presence of protic solvents.">

A potential solution lies in the non-local, distributed computation at the whole-brain level made possible by criticality and amplified by the rare long-range connections found in the brain’s unique anatomical structure. This non-locality can be captured by the mathematical structure of Schrödinger’s wave equation, which is at the heart of the novel CHARM (Complex Harmonics decomposition) framework that performs the necessary dimensional manifold reduction able to extract non-locality in critical spacetime brain dynamics. Using a large neuroimaging dataset of over 1,000 people, CHARM captured the critical, non-local/long-range nature of brain dynamics and the underlying mechanisms were established using a precise whole-brain model. Equally, CHARM revealed the significantly different critical dynamics of wakefulness and sleep. Overall, CHARM is a promising theoretical framework for capturing the low-dimensionality of the complex network dynamics observed in neuroscience and provides evidence that networks of brain regions rather than individual brain regions are the key computational engines of critical brain dynamics.">

More precisely, the input space $\mathfrak X$ is allowed to be a general topological space satisfying only a mild condition ("quasi-Polish"), and the output space can be either another quasi-Polish space $\mathfrak Y$ or a topological vector space $E$. Similarly to arXiv:2109.13512v4, we show furthermore that our neural network architectures can be projected down to"finite dimensional"subspaces with any desirable accuracy, thus obtaining approximating networks that are easy to implement and allow for fast computation and fitting. The resulting neural network architecture is therefore applicable for prediction tasks based on functional data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result which deals with such a wide class of input/output spaces and simultaneously guarantees the numerical feasibility of the ensuing architectures. Finally, we prove an obstruction result which indicates that the category of quasi-Polish spaces is in a certain sense the correct category to work with if one aims at constructing approximating architectures on infinite-dimensional spaces $\mathfrak X$ which, at the same time, have sufficient expressive power to approximate continuous functions on $\mathfrak X$, are specified by a finite number of parameters only and are"stable"with respect to these parameters.">

We propose to use"low-rank plus diagonal"PSD matrices as approximations that can be stored with a memory cost being linear in the high dimension d. To constrain the solution of the differential equation to remain in that subset, we project the derivative at all times onto the tangent space to the subset, following the methodology of dynamical low-rank approximation. We derive a closed-form formula for the projection, and show that after some manipulations it can be computed with a numerical cost being linear in d, allowing for tractable implementation. Contrary to previous approaches based on pure low-rank approximations, the addition of the diagonal term allows for our approximations to be invertible matrices, that can moreover be inverted with linear cost in d. We apply the technique to Riccati-like equations, then to two particular problems. Firstly a low-rank approximation to our recent Wasserstein gradient flow for Gaussian approximation of posterior distributions in approximate Bayesian inference, and secondly a novel low-rank approximation of the Kalman filter for high-dimensional systems.

Here we suggest that combination of symmetry-aware invariant architectures and stacks of dilated convolutions is a very effective and easy to implement receipt allowing sizable improvements in accuracy over standard approaches. We apply it to representative physical problems from different realms: prediction of bandgaps of photonic crystals, and network approximations of magnetic ground states.

While targeting to reduce the computational costs by diffusion in latent space, latent diffusion models also offer the possibility to integrate physical knowledge into the generation process. We tailor latent diffusion models to sea-ice physics with a censored Gaussian distribution in data space to generate data that follows the physical bounds of the modelled variables. Our latent diffusion models reach similar scores as the diffusion model trained in data space, but they smooth the generated fields as caused by the latent mapping. While enforcing physical bounds cannot reduce the smoothing, it improves the representation of the marginal ice zone. Therefore, for large-scale Earth system modelling, latent diffusion models can have many advantages compared to diffusion in data space if the significant barrier of smoothing can be resolved.">

        <tr id="The advancement of scientific machine learning (ML) techniques has led to the development of methods for approximating solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) with increased efficiency and accuracy. Automatic differentiation has played a pivotal role in this progress, enabling the creation of physics-informed neural networks (PINN) that integrate relevant physics into machine learning models. PINN have shown promise in approximating the solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, overcoming the limitations of traditional numerical discretization methods. However, challenges such as local minima and long training times persist, motivating the exploration of domain decomposition techniques to improve it. Previous domain decomposition models have introduced spatial and temporal domain decompositions but have yet to fully address issues of smoothness and regularity of global solutions. In this study, we present a novel domain decomposition approach for PINN, termed domain-discretized PINN (DD-PINN), which incorporates complementary loss functions, subdomain-specific transformer networks (TRF), and independent optimization within each subdomain. By enforcing continuity and differentiability through interface constraints and leveraging the Sobolev (H 1) norm of the mean squared error (MSE), rather than the Euclidean norm (L 2), DD-PINN enhances solution regularity and accuracy. The inclusion of TRF in each subdomain facilitates feature extraction and improves convergence rates, as demonstrated through simulations of threetest problems: steady-state flow in a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity, the time-dependent cylinder wake, and the viscous Burgers equation. Numerical comparisons highlight the effectiveness of DD-PINN in preserving global solution regularity and accurately approximating complex phenomena, marking a significant advancement over previous domain decomposition methods within the PINN framework.">

The ability of these tools to learn a target function is directly related to the eigenvalues of their kernel sampled on the input data. Targets having support on higher eigenvalues are more learnable. While kernels are often highly symmetric objects, the data is often not. Thus kernel symmetry seems to have little to no bearing on the above eigenvalues or learnability, making spectral analysis on real-world data challenging. Here, we show that contrary to this common lure, one may use eigenvalues and eigenfunctions associated with highly idealized data-measures to bound learnability on realistic data. As a demonstration, we give a theoretical lower bound on the sample complexity of copying heads for kernels associated with generic transformers acting on natural language.">

However, the computational prediction of the relative stability between phases based on their free energy is a daunting task, as traditional free energy estimators require a large amount of simulation data to obtain uncorrelated equilibrium samples over a grid of thermodynamic states. In this work, we develop deep generative machine learning models for entire phase diagrams, employing normalizing flows conditioned on the thermodynamic states, e.g., temperature and pressure, that they map to. By training a single normalizing flow to transform the equilibrium distribution sampled at only one reference thermodynamic state to a wide range of target temperatures and pressures, we can efficiently generate equilibrium samples across the entire phase diagram. Using a permutation-equivariant architecture allows us, thereby, to treat solid and liquid phases on the same footing. We demonstrate our approach by predicting the solid-liquid coexistence line for a Lennard-Jones system in excellent agreement with state-of-the-art free energy methods while significantly reducing the number of energy evaluations needed.">

Here, we show both empirically and theoretically that learning of the target function is preceded by an early phase in which networks learn the optimal constant solution (OCS) - that is, initial model responses mirror the distribution of target labels, while entirely ignoring information provided in the input. Using a hierarchical category learning task, we derive exact solutions for learning dynamics in deep linear networks trained with bias terms. Even when initialized to zero, this simple architectural feature induces substantial changes in early dynamics. We identify hallmarks of this early OCS phase and illustrate how these signatures are observed in deep linear networks and larger, more complex (and nonlinear) convolutional neural networks solving a hierarchical learning task based on MNIST and CIFAR10. We explain these observations by proving that deep linear networks necessarily learn the OCS during early learning. To further probe the generality of our results, we train human learners over the course of three days on the category learning task. We then identify qualitative signatures of this early OCS phase in terms of the dynamics of true negative (correct-rejection) rates. Surprisingly, we find the same early reliance on the OCS in the behaviour of human learners. Finally, we show that learning of the OCS can emerge even in the absence of bias terms and is equivalently driven by generic correlations in the input data. Overall, our work suggests the OCS as a universal learning principle in supervised, error-corrective learning, and the mechanistic reasons for its prevalence.">

        <tr id="Cryo-EM is a vital technique for determining 3D structure of biological molecules such as proteins and viruses. The cryo-EM reconstruction problem is challenging due to the high noise levels, the missing poses of particles, and the computational demands of processing large datasets. A promising solution to these challenges lies in the use of amortized inference methods, which have shown particular efficacy in pose estimation for large datasets. However, these methods also encounter convergence issues, often necessitating sophisticated initialization strategies or engineered solutions for effective convergence. Building upon the existing cryoAI pipeline, which employs a symmetric loss function to address convergence problems, this work explores the emergence and persistence of these issues within the pipeline. Additionally, we explore the impact of equivariant amortized inference on enhancing convergence. Our investigations reveal that, when applied to simulated data, a pipeline incorporating an equivariant encoder not only converges faster and more frequently than the standard approach but also demonstrates superior performance in terms of pose estimation accuracy and the resolution of the reconstructed volume. Notably, $D_4$-equivariant encoders make the symmetric loss superfluous and, therefore, allow for a more efficient reconstruction pipeline.">

While training is cheap, samples are generated via simulation, which is more expensive than one-step models like GANs. To close this gap, we introduce flow map matching -- an algorithm that learns the two-time flow map of an underlying ordinary differential equation. The approach leads to an efficient few-step generative model whose step count can be chosen a-posteriori to smoothly trade off accuracy for computational expense. Leveraging the stochastic interpolant framework, we introduce losses for both direct training of flow maps and distillation from pre-trained (or otherwise known) velocity fields. Theoretically, we show that our approach unifies many existing few-step generative models, including consistency models, consistency trajectory models, progressive distillation, and neural operator approaches, which can be obtained as particular cases of our formalism.

        <tr id="Most approaches for assessing causality in complex dynamical systems fail when the interactions between variables are inherently non-linear and non-stationary. Here we introduce Temporal Autoencoders for Causal Inference (TACI), a methodology that combines a new surrogate data metric for assessing causal interactions with a novel two-headed machine learning architecture to identify and measure the direction and strength of time-varying causal interactions. Through tests on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate TACI's ability to accurately quantify dynamic causal interactions across a variety of systems. Our findings display the method's effectiveness compared to existing approaches and also highlight our approach's potential to build a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that underlie time-varying interactions in physical and biological systems.">

Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method (FEM), suffer from long run times and large memory consumption. On the other hand, approaches based on graph neural networks are faster but still suffer from long computation times on dense graphs, which are often required for high-fidelity simulations. Our model, GIOROM or Graph Interaction Operator for Reduced-Order Modeling, learns temporal dynamics within a reduced-order setting, capturing spatial features from a highly sparse graph representation of the input and generalizing to arbitrary spatial locations during inference. The model is geometry-aware and discretization-agnostic and can generalize to different initial conditions, velocities, and geometries after training. We show that point clouds of the order of 100,000 points can be inferred from sparse graphs with $\sim$1000 points, with negligible change in computation time. We empirically evaluate our model on elastic solids, Newtonian fluids, Non-Newtonian fluids, Drucker-Prager granular flows, and von Mises elastoplasticity. On these benchmarks, our approach results in a 25$\times$ speedup compared to other neural network-based physics simulators while delivering high-fidelity predictions of complex physical systems and showing better performance on most benchmarks.

This makes MMF especially well suited to modeling certain types of graphs with complex multiscale or hierarchical strucutre. While MMF promises to yields a useful wavelet basis, finding the factorization itself is hard, and existing greedy methods tend to be brittle. In this paper, we propose a ``learnable'' version of MMF that carfully optimizes the factorization using metaheuristics, specifically evolutionary algorithms and directed evolution, along with Stiefel manifold optimization through backpropagating errors. We show that the resulting wavelet basis far outperforms prior MMF algorithms and gives comparable performance on standard learning tasks on graphs. Furthermore, we construct the wavelet neural networks (WNNs) learning graphs on the spectral domain with the wavelet basis produced by our MMF learning algorithm.

They show attractive performance for ill-conditioned problems, in part because they better approximate the matrix inverse from appropriately generated training data. Empirical evaluation on over 800 matrices suggests that the construction time of these graph neural preconditioners (GNPs) is more predictable than other widely used ones, such as ILU and AMG, while the execution time is faster than using a Krylov method as the preconditioner, such as in inner-outer GMRES.

However, existing dimension reduction methods often discuss communication in the absence of a formal framework, while frameworks proposed to address this gap are impractical in data analysis. This work bridges the formal framework of M-Information Flow with practical analysis of real neural data. To this end, we propose Iterative Regression, a message-dependent linear dimension reduction technique that iteratively finds an orthonormal basis such that each basis vector maximizes correlation between the projected data and the message. We then define 'M-forwarding' to formally capture the notion of a message being forwarded from one neural population to another. We apply our methodology to recordings we collected from two neural populations in a simplified model of whisker-based sensory detection in mice, and show that the low-dimensional M-forwarding structure we infer supports biological evidence of a similar structure between the two original, high-dimensional populations.">

We assess the efficiency of a set of physically-inspired moves, whose proposal distributions are optimized through on-policy learning. Compared to conventional Monte Carlo methods, the optimized proposals are two orders of magnitude faster for an additive soft sphere mixture, but yield a much more limited speed-up for the well-studied Kob-Andersen model.

In this paper, we present a theory of stochastic optimal control (SOC) tailored to infinite-dimensional spaces, aiming to extend diffusion-based algorithms to function spaces. Specifically, we demonstrate how Doob's $h$-transform, the fundamental tool for constructing diffusion bridges, can be derived from the SOC perspective and expanded to infinite dimensions. This expansion presents a challenge, as infinite-dimensional spaces typically lack closed-form densities. Leveraging our theory, we establish that solving the optimal control problem with a specific objective function choice is equivalent to learning diffusion-based generative models. We propose two applications: (1) learning bridges between two infinite-dimensional distributions and (2) generative models for sampling from an infinite-dimensional distribution. Our approach proves effective for diverse problems involving continuous function space representations, such as resolution-free images, time-series data, and probability density functions.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we provide a multiscale perspective on the problem of maximum marginal likelihood estimation. We consider and analyse a diffusion-based maximum marginal likelihood estimation scheme using ideas from multiscale dynamics. Our perspective is based on stochastic averaging; we make an explicit connection between ideas in applied probability and parameter inference in computational statistics. In particular, we consider a general class of coupled Langevin diffusions for joint inference of latent variables and parameters in statistical models, where the latent variables are sampled from a fast Langevin process (which acts as a sampler), and the parameters are updated using a slow Langevin process (which acts as an optimiser). We show that the resulting system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) can be viewed as a two-time scale system. To demonstrate the utility of such a perspective, we show that the averaged parameter dynamics obtained in the limit of scale separation can be used to estimate the optimal parameter, within the strongly convex setting. We do this by using recent uniform-in-time non-asymptotic averaging bounds. Finally, we conclude by showing that the slow-fast algorithm we consider here, termed Slow-Fast Langevin Algorithm, performs on par with state-of-the-art methods on a variety of examples. We believe that the stochastic averaging approach we provide in this paper enables us to look at these algorithms from a fresh angle, as well as unlocking the path to develop and analyse new methods using well-established averaging principles.">

Inspired by second order B-spline wavelets, we incorporate a set of simple constraints to the ReLU neurons in each layer of a deep neural network (DNN) to remedy the spectral bias. This in turn enables its use for various INR tasks. Empirically, we demonstrate that, contrary to popular belief, one can learn state-of-the-art INRs based on a DNN composed of only ReLU neurons. Next, by leveraging recent theoretical works which characterize the kinds of functions ReLU neural networks learn, we provide a way to quantify the regularity of the learned function. This offers a principled approach to selecting the hyperparameters in INR architectures. We substantiate our claims through experiments in signal representation, super resolution, and computed tomography, demonstrating the versatility and effectiveness of our method.

        <tr id="Stochastic dynamics on sparse graphs and disordered systems often lead to complex behaviors characterized by heterogeneity in time and spatial scales, slow relaxation, localization, and aging phenomena. The mathematical tools and approximation techniques required to analyze these complex systems are still under development, posing significant technical challenges and resulting in a reliance on numerical simulations. We introduce a novel computational framework for investigating the dynamics of sparse disordered systems with continuous degrees of freedom. Starting with a graphical model representation of the dynamic partition function for a system of linearly-coupled stochastic differential equations, we use dynamic cavity equations on locally tree-like factor graphs to approximate the stochastic measure. Here, cavity marginals are identified with local functionals of single-site trajectories. Our primary approximation involves a second-order truncation of a small-coupling expansion, leading to a Gaussian form for the cavity marginals. For linear dynamics with additive noise, this method yields a closed set of causal integro-differential equations for cavity versions of one-time and two-time averages. These equations provide an exact dynamical description within the local tree-like approximation, retrieving classical results for the spectral density of sparse random matrices. Global constraints, non-linear forces, and state-dependent noise terms can be addressed using a self-consistent perturbative closure technique. The resulting equations resemble those of dynamical mean-field theory in the mode-coupling approximation used for fully-connected models.

        <tr id="We consider deep neural networks in a Bayesian framework with a prior distribution sampling the network weights at random. Following a recent idea of Agapiou and Castillo (2023), who show that heavy-tailed prior distributions achieve automatic adaptation to smoothness, we introduce a simple Bayesian deep learning prior based on heavy-tailed weights and ReLU activation. We show that the corresponding posterior distribution achieves near-optimal minimax contraction rates, simultaneously adaptive to both intrinsic dimension and smoothness of the underlying function, in a variety of contexts including nonparametric regression, geometric data and Besov spaces. While most works so far need a form of model selection built-in within the prior distribution, a key aspect of our approach is that it does not require to sample hyperparameters to learn the architecture of the network. We also provide variational Bayes counterparts of the results, that show that mean-field variational approximations still benefit from near-optimal theoretical support.">

        <tr id="Beyond estimating parameters of interest from data, one of the key goals of statistical inference is to properly quantify uncertainty in these estimates. In Bayesian inference, this uncertainty is provided by the posterior distribution, the computation of which typically involves an intractable high-dimensional integral. Among available approximation methods, sampling-based approaches come with strong theoretical guarantees but scale poorly to large problems, while variational approaches scale well but offer few theoretical guarantees. In particular, variational methods are known to produce overconfident estimates of posterior uncertainty and are typically non-identifiable, with many latent variable configurations generating equivalent predictions. Here, we address these challenges by showing how diffusion-based models (DBMs), which have recently produced state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling tasks, can be repurposed for performing calibrated, identifiable Bayesian inference. By exploiting a previously established connection between the stochastic and probability flow ordinary differential equations (pfODEs) underlying DBMs, we derive a class of models, inflationary flows, that uniquely and deterministically map high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional Gaussian distribution via ODE integration. This map is both invertible and neighborhood-preserving, with controllable numerical error, with the result that uncertainties in the data are correctly propagated to the latent space. We demonstrate how such maps can be learned via standard DBM training using a novel noise schedule and are effective at both preserving and reducing intrinsic data dimensionality. The result is a class of highly expressive generative models, uniquely defined on a low-dimensional latent space, that afford principled Bayesian inference.">

        <tr id="Recent work has suggested using Monte Carlo methods based on piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) to sample from target distributions of interest. PDMPs are non-reversible continuous-time processes endowed with momentum, and hence can mix better than standard reversible MCMC samplers. Furthermore, they can incorporate exact sub-sampling schemes which only require access to a single (randomly selected) data point at each iteration, yet without introducing bias to the algorithm's stationary distribution. However, the range of models for which PDMPs can be used, particularly with sub-sampling, is limited. We propose approximate simulation of PDMPs with sub-sampling for scalable sampling from posterior distributions. The approximation takes the form of an Euler approximation to the true PDMP dynamics, and involves using an estimate of the gradient of the log-posterior based on a data sub-sample. We thus call this class of algorithms stochastic-gradient PDMPs. Importantly, the trajectories of stochastic-gradient PDMPs are continuous and can leverage recent ideas for sampling from measures with continuous and atomic components. We show these methods are easy to implement, present results on their approximation error and demonstrate numerically that this class of algorithms has similar efficiency to, but is more robust than, stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics.">

Many complex systems for which data-driven modeling and control are sought provide streaming sensor data, the abundance of which can present computational challenges but cannot be ignored. Streaming data can intermittently sample dynamically different regimes or rare events which could be critical to model and control. Using ideas from subspace identification, we present a method where the Grassmannian distance between the subspace of an extended observability matrix and the streaming segment of data is used to assess the `novelty' of the data. If this distance is above a threshold, it is added to an archive and the Koopman operator is updated if not it is discarded. Therefore, our method identifies data from segments of trajectories of a dynamical system that are from different dynamical regimes, prioritizes minimizing the amount of data needed in updating the Koopman model and furthermore reduces the number of basis functions by learning them adaptively. Therefore, by dynamically adjusting the amount of data used and learning basis functions, our method optimizes the model's accuracy and the system order.">

        <tr id="Approximation of solutions to partial differential equations (PDE) is an important problem in computational science and engineering. Using neural networks as an ansatz for the solution has proven a challenge in terms of training time and approximation accuracy. In this contribution, we discuss how sampling the hidden weights and biases of the ansatz network from data-agnostic and data-dependent probability distributions allows us to progress on both challenges. In most examples, the random sampling schemes outperform iterative, gradient-based optimization of physics-informed neural networks regarding training time and accuracy by several orders of magnitude. For time-dependent PDE, we construct neural basis functions only in the spatial domain and then solve the associated ordinary differential equation with classical methods from scientific computing over a long time horizon. This alleviates one of the greatest challenges for neural PDE solvers because it does not require us to parameterize the solution in time. For second-order elliptic PDE in Barron spaces, we prove the existence of sampled networks with $L^2$ convergence to the solution. We demonstrate our approach on several time-dependent and static PDEs. We also illustrate how sampled networks can effectively solve inverse problems in this setting. Benefits compared to common numerical schemes include spectral convergence and mesh-free construction of basis functions.">

The proposed method meta-learns our neural network-based model using datasets in various dynamical systems, such that our model can predict vector fields of unseen systems. In our model, a system representation is inferred from given small data using an encoder network. Then, the system-specific vector field is predicted by modeling the Hamiltonian using a Gaussian process (GP) with neural network-based mean and kernel functions that depend on the inferred system representation. This GP-based Hamiltonian allows us to analytically obtain predictions that are adapted to small data while imposing the constraint of the conservation law. The neural networks are shared across systems, which enables us to learn knowledge from multiple systems, and use it for unseen systems. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods for predicting dynamics from a small number of observations in target systems.">

        <tr id="Empirically, large-scale deep learning models often satisfy a neural scaling law: the test error of the trained model improves polynomially as the model size and data size grow. However, conventional wisdom suggests the test error consists of approximation, bias, and variance errors, where the variance error increases with model size. This disagrees with the general form of neural scaling laws, which predict that increasing model size monotonically improves performance. We study the theory of scaling laws in an infinite dimensional linear regression setup. Specifically, we consider a model with $M$ parameters as a linear function of sketched covariates. The model is trained by one-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) using $N$ data. Assuming the optimal parameter satisfies a Gaussian prior and the data covariance matrix has a power-law spectrum of degree $a>1$, we show that the reducible part of the test error is $\Theta(M^{-(a-1)} + N^{-(a-1)/a})$. The variance error, which increases with $M$, is dominated by the other errors due to the implicit regularization of SGD, thus disappearing from the bound. Our theory is consistent with the empirical neural scaling laws and verified by numerical simulation.">

We demonstrate experimentally that the increase in the sharpness of the Hessian matrix is caused by the layerwise Jacobian matrices of the network becoming aligned, so that a small change in the network preactivations near the inputs of the network can cause a large change in the outputs of the network. We further demonstrate that the degree of alignment scales with the size of the dataset by a power law with a coefficient of determination between 0.74 and 0.98.">

Validating with MD simulations of Ni solid-liquid systems, the model achieved accurate one-step-ahead prediction for time variation of the potential energy during solidification and melting processes using residual connections. Recursive use of predicted values enabled long-term prediction from just the first 20 snapshots of the MD simulation. The prediction has captured the feature of potential energy bending at low temperatures, which represents completion of solidification, despite that the MD data in short time do not have such a bending characteristic. Remarkably, for long-time prediction over 900 ps, the computation time was reduced to 1/700th of a full MD simulation of the same duration.

The inverse modelling is achieved via an adaptive Regularized Ensemble Kalman inversion (aREKI) method, ideal for rapid inverse uncertainty quantification during history matching. We parametrize unknown permeability and porosity fields for non-Gaussian posterior measures using a variational convolution autoencoder and a denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) exotic priors. The CCR works as a supervised model with the PINO surrogate to replicate nonlinear Peaceman well equations. The CCR's flexibility allows any independent machine-learning algorithm for each stage. The PINO reservoir surrogate's loss function is derived from supervised data loss and losses from the initial conditions and residual of the governing black oil PDE. The PINO-CCR surrogate outputs pressure, water, and gas saturations, along with oil, water, and gas production rates. The methodology was compared to a standard numerical black oil simulator for a waterflooding case on the Norne field, showing similar outputs. This PINO-CCR surrogate was then used in the aREKI history matching workflow, successfully recovering the unknown permeability, porosity and fault multiplier, with simulations up to 6000 times faster than conventional methods. Training the PINO-CCR surrogate on an NVIDIA H100 with 80G memory takes about 5 hours for 100 samples of the Norne field. This workflow is suitable for ensemble-based approaches, where posterior density sampling, given an expensive likelihood evaluation, is desirable for uncertainty quantification.">

        <tr id="Reduced basis methods for approximating the solutions of parameter-dependant partial differential equations (PDEs) are based on learning the structure of the set of solutions - seen as a manifold ${\mathcal S}$ in some functional space - when the parameters vary. This involves investigating the manifold and, in particular, understanding whether it is close to a low-dimensional affine space. This leads to the notion of Kolmogorov $N$-width that consists of evaluating to which extent the best choice of a vectorial space of dimension $N$ approximates ${\mathcal S}$ well enough. If a good approximation of elements in ${\mathcal S}$ can be done with some well-chosen vectorial space of dimension $N$ -- provided $N$ is not too large -- then a ``reduced'' basis can be proposed that leads to a Galerkin type method for the approximation of any element in ${\mathcal S}$. In many cases, however, the Kolmogorov $N$-width is not so small, even if the parameter set lies in a space of small dimension yielding a manifold with small dimension. In terms of complexity reduction, this gap between the small dimension of the manifold and the large Kolmogorov $N$-width can be explained by the fact that the Kolmogorov $N$-width is linear while, in contrast, the dependency in the parameter is, most often, non-linear. There have been many contributions aiming at reconciling these two statements, either based on deterministic or AI approaches. We investigate here further a new paradigm that, in some sense, merges these two aspects: the nonlinear compressive reduced basisapproximation. We focus on a simple multiparameter problem and illustrate rigorously that the complexity associated with the approximation of the solution to the parameter dependant PDE is directly related to the number of parameters rather than the Kolmogorov $N$-width.">

        <tr id="In this study, we introduce a unified neural network architecture, the Deep Equilibrium Density Functional Theory Hamiltonian (DEQH) model, which incorporates Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) for predicting Density Functional Theory (DFT) Hamiltonians. The DEQH model inherently captures the self-consistency nature of Hamiltonian, a critical aspect often overlooked by traditional machine learning approaches for Hamiltonian prediction. By employing DEQ within our model architecture, we circumvent the need for DFT calculations during the training phase to introduce the Hamiltonian's self-consistency, thus addressing computational bottlenecks associated with large or complex systems. We propose a versatile framework that combines DEQ with off-the-shelf machine learning models for predicting Hamiltonians. When benchmarked on the MD17 and QH9 datasets, DEQHNet, an instantiation of the DEQH framework, has demonstrated a significant improvement in prediction accuracy. Beyond a predictor, the DEQH model is a Hamiltonian solver, in the sense that it uses the fixed-point solving capability of the deep equilibrium model to iteratively solve for the Hamiltonian. Ablation studies of DEQHNet further elucidate the network's effectiveness, offering insights into the potential of DEQ-integrated networks for Hamiltonian learning.">

The performance of the algorithm is compared with that of tensor cross-interpolation (TCI) and multiscale interpolative constructions through a comprehensive comparative study. When function evaluation is inexpensive or when the function is not analytical, TCI is generally more efficient for function loading. However, the proposed method shows competitive performance, outperforming TCI in certain multivariate scenarios. Moreover, it shows advantageous scaling rates and generalizes to a wider range of tasks by providing a framework for function composition in MPS, which is useful for non-linear problems and many-body statistical physics.">

        <tr id="Herein the topics of (natural) gradient descent, data decorrelation, and approximate methods for backpropagation are brought into a dialogue. Natural gradient descent illuminates how gradient vectors, pointing at directions of steepest descent, can be improved by considering the local curvature of loss landscapes. We extend this perspective and show that to fully solve the problem illuminated by natural gradients in neural networks, one must recognise that correlations in the data at any linear transformation, including node responses at every layer of a neural network, cause a non-orthonormal relationship between the model's parameters. To solve this requires a solution to decorrelate inputs at each individual layer of a neural network. We describe a range of methods which have been proposed for decorrelation and whitening of node output, while providing a novel method specifically useful for distributed computing and computational neuroscience. Implementing decorrelation within multi-layer neural networks, we can show that not only is training via backpropagation sped up significantly but also existing approximations of backpropagation, which have failed catastrophically in the past, are made performant once more. This has the potential to provide a route forward for approximate gradient descent methods which have previously been discarded, training approaches for analogue and neuromorphic hardware, and potentially insights as to the efficacy and utility of decorrelation processes in the brain.">

        <tr id="Despite innumerable efforts to characterize C. elegans neural activity and behavior, the roles of each individual neuron and the compositional mechanisms of all their interactions are still not completely known. In particular, there is evidence that C. elegans neurons perform changing roles over time, in different behavioral contexts, etc.; however, existing stationary anatomical and functional connectivity can average across time and obfuscate the nonstationary nature of the neural dynamics. We contribute to these efforts by leveraging recent advances in decomposed linear dynamical systems (dLDS) models. dLDS models neural dynamics in a latent space with a set of linear operators that can be recombined and reused over time, enabling the discovery of multiple parallel neural processes on different timescales. We leverage the ability to identify reused patterns of dynamical neural interactions, which we call “dynamical connectivity,” to 1) identify contextually dependent roles of neurons; 2) discover the underlying variability of neural representations even under discrete behaviors; 3) quantify differences between anatomical, functional, and dynamical connectivity; and 4) learn a single aligned latent space underlying multiple individual worms’ activity. These results highlight the importance of defining a neuron’s functions not solely by its internal activity or place in a time-averaged network, but by its evolving interactions across context-dependent circuits.">

In this work, we consider a modified Symbolic Artificial Neural Network-Trained Expressions (SymANNTEx) architecture for this task, an architecture more expressive than others in the literature. We make a modification to the model pipeline to optimize the regression, then characterize the behavior of the adjusted model in identifying several classical chaotic maps. With the goal of parsimony, sparsity-inducing weight regularization and information theory-informed simplification are implemented. We show that our modified SymANNTEx model properly identifies single-state maps and achieves moderate success in approximating a dual-state attractor.

        <tr id="Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have been widely used to facilitate large scale molecular simulations with ab initio level accuracy. However, MLIP-based molecular simulations frequently encounter the issue of collapse due to decreased prediction accuracy for out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To mitigate this issue, it is crucial to enrich the training set with active learning, where uncertainty estimation serves as an effective method for identifying and collecting OOD data. Therefore, a feasible method for uncertainty estimation in MLIPs is desired. The existing methods either require expensive computations or compromise prediction accuracy. In this work, we introduce evidential deep learning for interatomic potentials (eIP) with a physics-inspired design. Our experiments demonstrate that eIP consistently generates reliable uncertainties without incurring notable additional computational costs, while the prediction accuracy remains unchanged. Furthermore, we present an eIP-based active learning workflow, where eIP is used not only to estimate the uncertainty of molecular data but also to perform uncertainty-driven dynamics simulations. Our findings show that eIP enables efficient sampling for a more diverse dataset, thereby advancing the feasibility of MLIP-based molecular simulations.">

The maintenance and replacement of aging infrastructure is becoming increasingly costly, as a large number of structures is approaching the end of its design lifetime. Labor intensive manual inspection and assessment on a large scale is often infeasible, while data-driven machine learning techniques can fail to identify relevant failure mechanisms and suffer from poor generalization to previously unseen conditions, particularly when data is sparse. We propose a multi-task learning approach based on a physics-informed variational autoencoder that leverages a dictionary of physics-based models to improve the predictive performance when limited data is available. The latent space of the autoencoder is augmented with a set of physics-based latent variables that are interpretable and allow for prior knowledge on the latent variables to be included in the autoencoder formulation. To prevent the data-driven components of the encoder and decoder from overriding the known physics, a regularization method is used to impose physical constraints on the latent space and the generative model prediction. The feasibility of the proposed approach is evaluated on a case study of quay walls in Amsterdam, demonstrating improved performance over purely data-driven methods.

        <tr id="We combine power functional theory and machine learning to study non-equilibrium overdamped many-body systems of colloidal particles at the level of one-body fields. We first sample in steady state the one-body fields relevant for the dynamics from computer simulations of Brownian particles under the influence of randomly generated external fields. A neural network is then trained with this data to represent locally in space the formally exact functional mapping from the one-body density and velocity profiles to the one-body internal force field. The trained network is used to analyse the non-equilibrium superadiabatic force field and the transport coefficients such as shear and bulk viscosities. Due to the local learning approach, the network can be applied to systems much larger than the original simulation box in which the one-body fields are sampled. Complemented with the exact non-equilibrium one-body force balance equation and a continuity equation, the network yields viable predictions of the dynamics in time-dependent situations. Even though training is based on steady states only, the predicted dynamics is in good agreement with simulation results. A neural dynamical density functional theory can be straightforwardly implemented as a limiting case in which the internal force field is that of an equilibrium system. The framework is general and directly applicable to other many-body systems of interacting particles following Brownian dynamics.">

However, a sufficiently rigorous statement and theoretical proof of this heuristic is lacking in the literature. In this paper, we provide several novel contributions to the literature in this regard. Defining a new notion of nonlocal directional derivative, we analyze its theoretical properties (existence and convergence). Second, using a probabilistic reformulation, we show that nonlocal derivatives are epsilon-sub gradients, and derive sample complexity results for convergence of stochastic gradient descent-like methods using nonlocal derivatives. Finally, using our analysis of the nonlocal gradient of Holder continuous functions, we observe that sample paths of Brownian motion admit nonlocal directional derivatives, and the nonlocal derivatives of Brownian motion are seen to be Gaussian processes with computable mean and standard deviation. Using the theory of nonlocal directional derivatives, we solve a highly nondifferentiable and nonconvex model problem of parameter estimation on image articulation manifolds. Using Brownian motion infused ReLU activation functions with the nonlocal gradient in place of the usual gradient during backpropagation, we also perform experiments on multiple well-studied deep learning architectures. Our experiments indicate the superior generalization capabilities of Brownian neural activation functions in low-training data regimes, where the use of stochastic neurons beats the deterministic ReLU counterpart.">

The RRNN method commences by decomposing the computational domain into non-overlapping subdomains. Within each subdomain, the solution to the localized subproblem is approximated by a randomized radial basis function neural network with a Gaussian kernel. This network is distinguished by the random assignment of width and center coefficients for its activation functions, thereby rendering the training process focused solely on determining the weight coefficients of the output layer. For each subproblem, similar to the Petrov-Galerkin finite element method, a linear system will be formulated on the foundation of a weak formulation. Subsequently, a selection of collocation points is stochastically sampled at the boundaries of the subdomain, ensuring satisfying $C^0$ and $C^1$ continuity and boundary conditions to couple these localized solutions. The network is ultimately trained using the least squares method to ascertain the output layer weights. To validate the RRNN method's effectiveness, an extensive array of numerical experiments has been executed and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the accuracy and efficiency well.">

We develop a dynamic programming algorithm that efficiently solves the likelihood, decoding, and parameter learning problems for tree-based HMMs with coupled branches. Our approach scales polynomially with the number of states and nodes, making it computationally feasible for a wide range of applications and does not suffer from the underflow problem. We demonstrate our algorithm by applying it to simulated data and propose self-consistency checks for validating the assumptions of the model used for inference.

Further, CoNO exhibits superior performance, outperforming all other models in additional tasks such as zero-shot super-resolution and robustness to noise. CoNO also exhibits the ability to learn from small amounts of data -- giving the same performance as the next best model with just 60% of the training data. Altogether, CoNO presents a robust and superior model for modeling continuous dynamical systems, providing a fillip to scientific machine learning.">

Even though we have a general understanding of the fundamental components in the transformer architecture, little is known about how they operate or what are their expected dynamics. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in exploring the relationship between attention mechanisms and Hopfield networks, promising to shed light on the statistical physics of transformer networks. However, to date, the dynamical regimes of transformer-like models have not been studied in depth. In this paper, we address this gap by using methods for the study of asymmetric Hopfield networks in nonequilibrium regimes --namely path integral methods over generating functionals, yielding dynamics governed by concurrent mean-field variables. Assuming 1-bit tokens and weights, we derive analytical approximations for the behavior of large self-attention neural networks coupled to a softmax output, which become exact in the large limit size. Our findings reveal nontrivial dynamical phenomena, including nonequilibrium phase transitions associated with chaotic bifurcations, even for very simple configurations with a few encoded features and a very short context window. Finally, we discuss the potential of our analytic approach to improve our understanding of the inner workings of transformer models, potentially reducing computational training costs and enhancing model interpretability.">

The neural computation underlying flexible cognition and behavior relies on dynamic control of these structures. For example different tasks or behaviors are represented on different subspaces, requiring fast timescale subspace rotation to move from one behavior to the next. For flexibility in a particular behavior, the neural trajectory must be dynamically controllable within that behaviorally determined subspace. To understand how dynamic control of neural trajectories and their underlying subspaces may be implemented in neural circuits, we first characterized the relationship between features of neural activity sequences and aspects of the low dimensional projection. Based on this, we propose neural mechanisms that can act within local circuits to modulate activity sequences thereby controlling neural trajectories in low dimensional subspaces. In particular, we show that gain modulation and transient synaptic currents control the speed and path of neural trajectories and clustered inhibition determines manifold orientation.

        <tr id="Neural networks, whice have had a profound effect on how researchers study complex phenomena, do so through a complex, nonlinear mathematical structure which can be difficult for human researchers to interpret. This obstacle can be especially salient when researchers want to better understand the emergence of particular model behaviors such as bias, overfitting, overparametrization, and more. In Neuroimaging, the understanding of how such phenomena emerge is fundamental to preventing and informing users of the potential risks involved in practice. In this work, we present a novel introspection framework for Deep Learning on Neuroimaging data, which exploits the natural structure of gradient computations via the singular value decomposition of gradient components during reverse-mode auto-differentiation. Unlike post-hoc introspection techniques, which require fully-trained models for evaluation, our method allows for the study of training dynamics on the fly, and even more interestingly, allow for the decomposition of gradients based on which samples belong to particular groups of interest. We demonstrate how the gradient spectra for several common deep learning models differ between schizophrenia and control participants from the COBRE study, and illustrate how these trajectories may reveal specific training dynamics helpful for further analysis.">

        <tr id="Investigating conformational landscapes of proteins is a crucial way to understand their biological functions and properties. AlphaFlow stands out as a sequence-conditioned generative model that introduces flexibility into structure prediction models by fine-tuning AlphaFold under the flow-matching framework. Despite the advantages of efficient sampling afforded by flow-matching, AlphaFlow still requires multiple runs of AlphaFold to finally generate one single conformation. Due to the heavy consumption of AlphaFold, its applicability is limited in sampling larger set of protein ensembles or the longer chains within a constrained timeframe. In this work, we propose a feature-conditioned generative model called AlphaFlow-Lit to realize efficient protein ensembles generation. In contrast to the full fine-tuning on the entire structure, we focus solely on the light-weight structure module to reconstruct the conformation. AlphaFlow-Lit performs on-par with AlphaFlow and surpasses its distilled version without pretraining, all while achieving a significant sampling acceleration of around 47 times. The advancement in efficiency showcases the potential of AlphaFlow-Lit in enabling faster and more scalable generation of protein ensembles.">

        <tr id="Addressing the sampling problem is central to obtaining quantitative insight from molecular dynamics simulations. Adaptive biased sampling methods, such as metadynamics, tackle this issue by perturbing the Hamiltonian of a system with a history-dependent bias potential, enhancing the exploration of the ensemble of configurations and estimating the corresponding free energy surface (FES). Nevertheless, efficiently assessing and systematically improving their convergence remains an open problem. Here, building on mean force integration (MFI), we develop and test a metric for estimating the convergence of FESs obtained by combining asynchronous, independent simulations subject to diverse biasing protocols, including static biases, different variants of metadynamics, and various combinations of static and history-dependent biases. The developed metric and the ability to combine independent simulations granted by MFI enable us to devise strategies to systematically improve the quality of FES estimates. We demonstrate our approach by computing FES and assessing the convergence of a range of systems of increasing complexity, including one- and two-dimensional analytical FESs, alanine dipeptide, a Lennard–Jones supersaturated vapor undergoing liquid droplet nucleation, and the model of a colloidal system crystallizing via a two-step mechanism. The methods presented here can be generally applied to biased simulations and are implemented in pyMFI, a publicly accessible, open-source Python library.">

Towards this goal, we develop DeepConformer, a diffusion generative model for sampling protein conformation distributions from a given amino acid sequence. Despite the lack of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data in training process, DeepConformer captured conformational flexibility and dynamics (RMSF and covariance matrix correlation) similar to MD simulation and reproduced experimentally observed conformational variations.

        <tr id="Protein folding is a critical process that determines the functional state of proteins. Proper folding is essential for proteins to acquire their functional three-dimensional structures and execute their biological role, whereas misfolded proteins can lead to various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Therefore, a deeper understanding of protein folding is vital for understanding disease mechanisms and developing therapeutic strategies. This study introduces the Stochastic Landscape Classification (SLC), an innovative, automated, nonlearning algorithm that quantitatively analyzes protein folding dynamics. Focusing on collective variables (CVs) – low-dimensional representations of complex dynamical systems like molecular dynamics (MD) of macromolecules – the SLC approach segments the CVs into distinct macrostates, revealing the protein folding pathway explored by MD simulations. The segmentation is achieved by analyzing changes in CV trends and clustering these segments using a standard density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) scheme. Applied to the MD-based CV trajectories of Chignolin and Trp-Cage proteins, the SLC demonstrates apposite accuracy, validated by comparing standard classification metrics against ground-truth data. These metrics affirm the efficacy of the SLC in capturing intricate protein dynamics and offer a method to evaluate and select the most informative CVs. The practical application of this technique lies in its ability to provide a detailed, quantitative description of protein folding processes, with significant implications for understanding and manipulating protein behavior in industrial and pharmaceutical contexts.">

We also compute the finite time and size scaling of general space-time fluctuations, which for the case of inactive regions gives rise to dynamical hydrophobicity. We also discuss how, through the Trotter limit, these exact results also hold for the continuous-time East model, thus proving long-standing observations in kinetically constrained models.

        <tr id="Model parameter inference is a universal problem across science. This challenge is particularly pronounced in developmental biology, where faithful mechanistic descriptions require spatial-stochastic models with numerous parameters, yet quantitative empirical data often lack sufficient granularity due to experimental limitations. Parameterizing such complex models thus necessitates methods that elaborate on classical Bayesian inference by incorporating notions of optimality and goal-orientation through low-dimensional objective functions that quantitatively capture the target behavior of the underlying system. In this study, we contrast two such inference workflows and apply them to biophysics-inspired spatial-stochastic models. Technically, both workflows are simulation-based inference (SBI) methods. The first method leverages a modern deep-learning technique known as sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE), while the second is based on a classical optimization technique called simulated annealing (SA). We evaluate these workflows by inferring the parameters of two complementary models for the inner cell mass (ICM) lineage differentiation in the blastocyst-stage mouse embryo. This developmental biology system serves as a paradigmatic example of a highly robust and reproducible cell-fate proportioning process that self-organizes under strongly stochastic conditions, such as intrinsic biochemical noise and cell-cell signaling delays. Our results indicate that while both methods largely agree in their predictions, the modern SBI workflow provides substantially richer inferred distributions at an equivalent computational cost. We identify the computational scenarios that favor the modern SBI method over its classical counterpart. Finally, we propose a plausible approach to integrate these two methods, thereby synergistically exploiting their parameter space exploration capabilities.">

        <tr id="It is a challenging topic in applied mathematics to solve high-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Standard approximation methods for nonlinear PDEs suffer under the curse of dimensionality (COD) in the sense that the number of computational operations of the approximation method grows at least exponentially in the PDE dimension and with such methods it is essentially impossible to approximately solve high-dimensional PDEs even when the fastest currently available computers are used. However, in the last years great progress has been made in this area of research through suitable deep learning (DL) based methods for PDEs in which deep neural networks (DNNs) are used to approximate solutions of PDEs. Despite the remarkable success of such DL methods in simulations, it remains a fundamental open problem of research to prove (or disprove) that such methods can overcome the COD in the approximation of PDEs. However, there are nowadays several partial error analysis results for DL methods for high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs in the literature which prove that DNNs can overcome the COD in the sense that the number of parameters of the approximating DNN grows at most polynomially in both the reciprocal of the prescribed approximation accuracy $\varepsilon>0$ and the PDE dimension $d\in\mathbb{N}$. In the main result of this article we prove that for all $T,p\in(0,\infty)$ it holds that solutions $u_d\colon[0,T]\times\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$, of semilinear heat equations with Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities can be approximated in the $L^p$-sense on space-time regions without the COD by DNNs with the rectified linear unit (ReLU), the leaky ReLU, or the softplus activation function. In previous articles similar results have been established not for space-time regions but for the solutions $u_d(T,\cdot)$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$, at the terminal time $T$.">

Learning must be performed while enforcing the numerical stability of the learned model, the existing knowledge within an informed or augmented setting, or by taking into account the multiscale dynamics—for both linear and nonlinear dynamics. However, when the final objective of such a learned dynamical system is to be used for control purposes, learning transformed dynamics can be advantageous. Therefore, many alternatives exists, and the present paper focuses on two of them: the first based on the discovery and use of the so-called flat control and the second one based on the use of the Koopman theory. The main contributions when addressing the first is the discovery of the flat output transformation by using an original neural framework. Moreover, when using the Koopman theory, this paper proposes an original procedure for learning parametric dynamics in the latent space, which is of particular interest in control-based engineering applications.">

        <tr id="Deep learning methods have been considered promising for accelerating molecular screening in drug discovery and material design. Due to the limited availability of labelled data, various self-supervised molecular pre-training methods have been presented. While many existing methods utilize common pre-training tasks in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), they often overlook the fundamental physical principles governing molecules. In contrast, applying denoising in pre-training can be interpreted as an equivalent force learning, but the limited noise distribution introduces bias into the molecular distribution. To address this issue, we introduce a molecular pre-training framework called fractional denoising (Frad), which decouples noise design from the constraints imposed by force learning equivalence. In this way, the noise becomes customizable, allowing for incorporating chemical priors to significantly improve molecular distribution modeling. Experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing state-of-the-art results across force prediction, quantum chemical properties, and binding affinity tasks. The refined noise design enhances force accuracy and sampling coverage, which contribute to the creation of physically consistent molecular representations, ultimately leading to superior predictive performance.">

However, these methods often encounter challenges when dealing with problems involving complex geometries. Machine learning-based methods, on the other hand, are mesh-free, thus providing a promising alternative. In particular, operator learning methods have been proposed to learn the mapping from the input space to the solution space, enabling rapid inference of solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) once trained. In this work, we address the parametric elliptic interface problem. Building upon the deep operator network (DeepONet), we propose an extended interface deep operator network (XI-DeepONet). XI-DeepONet exhibits three unique features: (1) The interface geometry is incorporated into the neural network as an additional input, enabling the network to infer solutions for new interface geometries once trained; (2) The level set function associated with the interface geometry is treated as the input, on which the solution mapping is continuous and can be effectively approximated by the deep operator network; (3) The network can be trained without any input-output data pairs, thus completely avoiding the need for meshes of any kind, directly or indirectly. We conduct a comprehensive series of numerical experiments to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method.">

        <tr id="This letter presents a high-dimensional analysis of the training dynamics for a single-layer nonlinear contrastive learning model. The empirical distribution of the model weights converges to a deterministic measure governed by a McKean-Vlasov nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE). Under L2 regularization, this PDE reduces to a closed set of low-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs), reflecting the evolution of the model performance during the training process. We analyze the fixed point locations and their stability of the ODEs unveiling several interesting findings. First, only the hidden variable's second moment affects feature learnability at the state with uninformative initialization. Second, higher moments influence the probability of feature selection by controlling the attraction region, rather than affecting local stability. Finally, independent noises added in the data argumentation degrade performance but negatively correlated noise can reduces the variance of gradient estimation yielding better performance. Despite of the simplicity of the analyzed model, it exhibits a rich phenomena of training dynamics, paving a way to understand more complex mechanism behind practical large models.">

        <tr id="Coarse-grained models describe the macroscopic mean response of a process at large scales, which derives from stochastic processes at small scales. Common examples include accounting for velocity fluctuations in a turbulent fluid flow model and cloud evolution in climate models. Most existing techniques for constructing coarse-grained models feature ill-defined parameters whose values are arbitrarily chosen (e.g., a window size), are narrow in their applicability (e.g., only applicable to time series or spatial data), or cannot readily incorporate physics information. Here, we introduce the concept of physics-guided Gaussian process regression as a machine-learning-based coarse-graining technique that is broadly applicable and amenable to input from known physics-based relationships. Using a pair of case studies derived from molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate the attractive properties and superior performance of physics-guided Gaussian processes for coarse-graining relative to prevalent benchmarks. The key advantage of Gaussian-process-based coarse-graining is its ability to seamlessly integrate data-driven and physics-based information.">

        <tr id="We propose a novel reduced-order methodology to describe complex multi-frequency fluid dynamics from time-resolved snapshot data. Starting point is the Cluster-based Network Model (CNM) thanks to its fully automatable development and human interpretability. Our key innovation is to model the transitions from cluster to cluster much more accurately by replacing snapshot states with short-term trajectories ("orbits") over multiple clusters, thus avoiding nonphysical intra-cluster diffusion in the dynamic reconstruction. The proposed orbital CNM (oCNM) employs functional clustering to coarse-grain the short-term trajectories. Specifically, different filtering techniques, resulting in different temporal basis expansions, demonstrate the versatility and capability of the oCNM to adapt to diverse flow phenomena. The oCNM is illustrated on the Stuart-Landau oscillator and its post-transient solution with time-varying parameters to test its ability to capture the amplitude selection mechanism and multi-frequency behaviours. Then, the oCNM is applied to the fluidic pinball across varying flow regimes at different Reynolds numbers, including the periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic dynamics. This orbital-focused perspective enhances the understanding of complex temporal behaviours by incorporating high-frequency behaviour into the kinematics of short-time trajectories while modelling the dynamics of the lower frequencies. In analogy to Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, which marked the transition from spatial-only modes to spatio-temporal ones, this work advances from analysing temporal local states to examining piecewise short-term trajectories, or orbits. By merging advanced analytical methods, such as the functional representation of short-time trajectories with CNM, this study paves the way for new approaches to dissect the complex dynamics characterising turbulent systems.">

        <tr id="De-interleaving of the mixtures of Hidden Markov Processes (HMPs) generally depends on its representation model. Existing representation models consider Markov chain mixtures rather than hidden Markov, resulting in the lack of robustness to non-ideal situations such as observation noise or missing observations. Besides, de-interleaving methods utilize a search-based strategy, which is time-consuming. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel representation model and corresponding de-interleaving methods for the mixtures of HMPs. At first, a generative model for representing the mixtures of HMPs is designed. Subsequently, the de-interleaving process is formulated as a posterior inference for the generative model. Secondly, an exact inference method is developed to maximize the likelihood of the complete data, and two approximate inference methods are developed to maximize the evidence lower bound by creating tractable structures. Then, a theoretical error probability lower bound is derived using the likelihood ratio test, and the algorithms are shown to get reasonably close to the bound. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods are highly effective and robust for non-ideal situations, outperforming baseline methods on simulated and real-life data.">

        <tr id="Deep learning has been extensively utilized for modeling and analysis of fluid turbulence. One such application is the use of super-resolution (SR) algorithms to reconstruct small-scale structures from their large-scale counterparts for turbulent flows. To date, all SR algorithms have been supervised or require unpaired reference data at a high resolution for training. This renders the model inapplicable to practical fluid flow scenarios, in which the generation of a high-resolution ground truth by resolving all scales down to the Kolmogorov scale becomes prohibitive. Hence, it is imperative to develop physics-guided models that exploit the multiscale nature of turbulence. Considering SR as a state-estimation problem, we present a self-supervised workflow based on deep neural networks to reconstruct small-scale structures that are relevant to homogeneous isotropic turbulence. In addition to visual similarity, we assessed the quality of the obtained reconstruction using spectra, structure functions, and probability density functions of the gradients of velocity and a passive scalar. From the analysis, we infer that the outputs of the workflow are in statistical agreement with the ground truth, for which the training pipeline is agnostic. Insights into learnability, interpretability, and generality of the trained networks have been provided as well. The results of this study can be leveraged to devise techniques for the reconstruction of small-scale structures using large-eddy simulation data.">

Most existed works build the model in the original geometric space, leading to high computational costs when the number of sample points is large.

In particular, we first propose Physics-Cross-Attention (PhCA) transforming representation from the geometric space to the latent space, then learn the operator in the latent space, and finally recover the real-world geometric space via the inverse PhCA map. Our model retains flexibility that can decode values in any position not limited to locations defined in training set, and therefore can naturally perform interpolation and extrapolation tasks particularly useful for inverse problems. Moreover, the proposed LNO improves in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments show that LNO reduces the GPU memory by 50%, speeds up training 1.8 times, and reaches state-of-the-art accuracy on four out of six benchmarks for forward problems and a benchmark for inverse problem.">

However, storing and transmitting these models pose significant challenges due to their massive size (e.g., 350GB for GPT-3). Recent literature has focused on compressing the original weights or reducing the number of parameters required for fine-tuning these models. These compression methods typically involve constraining the parameter space, for example, through low-rank reparametrization (e.g., LoRA) or quantization (e.g., QLoRA) during model training. In this paper, we present MCNC as a novel model compression method that constrains the parameter space to low-dimensional pre-defined and frozen nonlinear manifolds, which effectively cover this space. Given the prevalence of good solutions in over-parameterized deep neural networks, we show that by constraining the parameter space to our proposed manifold, we can identify high-quality solutions while achieving unprecedented compression rates across a wide variety of tasks. Through extensive experiments in computer vision and natural language processing tasks, we demonstrate that our method, MCNC, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of compression, accuracy, and/or model reconstruction time.">

While general physics-informed deep learning methods have shown early promise in learning fluid dynamics, they are difficult to generalize in arbitrary time instants in real-world scenario, where the fluid motion can be considered as a time-variant trajectory involved large-scale particles. Inspired by the advantage of diffusion model in learning the distribution of data, we first propose Pi-fusion, a physics-informed diffusion model for predicting the temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field in fluid dynamics. Physics-informed guidance sampling is proposed in the inference procedure of Pi-fusion to improve the accuracy and interpretability of learning fluid dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a training strategy based on reciprocal learning to learn the quasiperiodical pattern of fluid motion and thus improve the generalizability of the model. The proposed approach are then evaluated on both synthetic and real-world dataset, by comparing it with state-of-the-art physics-informed deep learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods for predicting temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field, confirming its strong generalization by drawing probabilistic inference of forward process and physics-informed guidance sampling. The proposed Pi-fusion can also be generalized in learning other physical dynamics governed by partial differential equations.">

While the convergence behavior of Langevin Dynamics under unimodal distributions has been extensively studied in the literature, in practice the data distribution could consist of multiple distinct modes. In this work, we investigate Langevin Dynamics in producing samples from multimodal distributions and theoretically study its mode-seeking properties. We prove that under a variety of sub-Gaussian mixtures, Langevin Dynamics is unlikely to find all mixture components within a sub-exponential number of steps in the data dimension. To reduce the mode-seeking tendencies of Langevin Dynamics, we propose Chained Langevin Dynamics, which divides the data vector into patches of constant size and generates every patch sequentially conditioned on the previous patches. We perform a theoretical analysis of Chained Langevin Dynamics by reducing it to sampling from a constant-dimensional distribution. We present the results of several numerical experiments on synthetic and real image datasets, supporting our theoretical results on the iteration complexities of sample generation from mixture distributions using the chained and vanilla Langevin Dynamics.

This is accomplished by extending the HiPPO framework to demonstrate that continuous SSMs can approximate the derivative of any input signal. Specifically, we find an explicit weight construction for continuous SSMs and provide an asymptotic error bound on the derivative approximation. The discretization of this continuous SSM subsequently yields a discrete SSM that predicts the next state. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our parameterization empirically.

        <tr id="Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved exceptional performance across various fields by learning complex nonlinear mappings from large-scale datasets. However, they encounter challenges such as high computational costs and limited interpretability. To address these issues, hybrid approaches that integrate physics with AI are gaining interest. This paper introduces a novel physics-based AI model called the"Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Network", which treats the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NLSE) as a general-purpose trainable model for learning complex patterns including nonlinear mappings and memory effects from data. Existing physics-informed machine learning methods use neural networks to approximate the solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs). In contrast, our approach directly treats the PDE as a trainable model to obtain general nonlinear mappings that would otherwise require neural networks. As a type of physics-AI symbiosis, it offers a more interpretable and parameter-efficient alternative to traditional black-box neural networks, achieving comparable or better accuracy in some time series classification tasks while significantly reducing the number of required parameters. Notably, the trained Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Network is interpretable, with all parameters having physical meanings as properties of a virtual physical system that transforms the data to a more separable space. This interpretability allows for insight into the underlying dynamics of the data transformation process. Applications to time series forecasting have also been explored. While our current implementation utilizes the NLSE, the proposed method of using physics equations as trainable models to learn nonlinear mappings from data is not limited to the NLSE and may be extended to other master equations of physics.">

        <tr id="The development of novel materials in recent years has been accelerated greatly by the use of computational modelling techniques aimed at elucidating the complex physics controlling microstructure formation in materials, the properties of which control material function. One such technique is the phase field method, a field theoretic approach that couples various thermophysical fields to microscopic order parameter fields that track the phases of microstructure. Phase field models are framed as multiple, non-linear, partial differential equations, which are extremely challenging to compute efficiently. Recent years have seen an explosion of computational algorithms aimed at enhancing the efficiency of phase field simulations. One such technique, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), dynamically adapts numerical meshes to be highly refined around steep spatial gradients of the PDE fields and coarser where the fields are smooth. This reduces the number of computations per time step significantly, thus reducing the total time of computation. What AMR doesn't do is allow for adaptive time stepping. This work combines AMR with a neural network algorithm that uses a U-Net with a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (CLSTM) base to accelerate phase field simulations. Our neural network algorithm is described in detail and tested in on simulations of directional solidification of a dilute binary alloy, a paradigm that is highly practical for its relevance to the solidification of alloys.">

Traditionally, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) are the neural network of choice, and significant progress has been made in optimizing their training. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) were introduced as a viable alternative, with the potential of offering better interpretability and efficiency while requiring fewer parameters. In this paper, we present a fast JAX-based implementation of grid-dependent Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) for solving PDEs. We propose an adaptive training scheme for PIKANs, incorporating known MLP-based PINN techniques, introducing an adaptive state transition scheme to avoid loss function peaks between grid updates, and proposing a methodology for designing PIKANs with alternative basis functions. Through comparative experiments we demonstrate that these adaptive features significantly enhance training efficiency and solution accuracy. Our results illustrate the effectiveness of PIKANs in improving performance for PDE solutions, highlighting their potential as a superior alternative in scientific and engineering applications.">

We introduce a method to identify time-parameterised families of almost-invariant sets in time-dependent dynamical systems, as well as the families' emergence and disappearance. In contrast to coherent sets, which may freely move about in phase space over time, our technique focuses on families of metastable sets that are quasi-stationary in space. Our straightforward approach extends successful transfer operator methods for almost-invariant sets to time-dependent dynamics and utilises the Ulam scheme for the generator of the transfer operator on a time-expanded domain. The new methodology is illustrated with an idealised fluid flow and with atmospheric velocity data.

We name this scenario $\textit{state-dependent}$ mobility edge: while the system does not exhibit a sharp separation in energy between thermal and non-thermal eigenstates, the abundance of non-thermal eigenstates results in slow entanglement growth for $\textit{many}$ initial states, such as product states, below a finite energy density. We characterize the state-dependent mobility edge by looking at the complexity of classically simulating dynamics using tensor network for system sizes well beyond those accessible via exact diagonalization. Focusing on initial product states, we observe a qualitative change in the dynamics of the bond dimension needed as a function of their energy density. Specifically, the bond dimension typically grows $\textit{polynomially}$ in time up to a certain energy density, where we locate the state-dependent mobility edge, enabling simulations for long times. Above this energy density, the bond dimension typically grows $\textit{exponentially}$ making the simulation practically unfeasible beyond short times, as generally expected in interacting theories. We correlate the polynomial growth of the bond dimension to the presence of many non-thermal eigenstates around that energy density, a subset of which we compute via tensor network.">

We test our approach by training a single cDDPM to perform multidimensional particle-wise unfolding for a variety of physics processes, including those not seen during training.

Due to the properties of flexible materials, the movements of soft objects are often highly nonlinear and, thus, complex to predict. Data-driven approaches seem promising for modeling those complex dynamics but often neglect basic physical principles, which consequently makes them untrustworthy and limits generalization. To address this problem, we propose a physics-constrained learning method that combines powerful learning tools and reliable physical models. Our method leverages the data collected from observations by sending them into a Gaussian process that is physically constrained by a distributed Port-Hamiltonian model. Based on the Bayesian nature of the Gaussian process, we not only learn the dynamics of the system, but also enable uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, the proposed approach preserves the compositional nature of Port-Hamiltonian systems.">

Accurately locating them is critical not just for deeper understanding of observed dynamic behavior, but also for designing efficient interventions. When the dynamical system at hand is complex, possibly noisy, and expensive to sample, standard (e.g. continuation based) numerical methods may become impractical. We propose an active learning framework, where Bayesian Optimization is leveraged to discover saddle-node or Hopf bifurcations, from a judiciously chosen small number of vector field observations. Such an approach becomes especially attractive in systems whose state x parameter space exploration is resource-limited. It also naturally provides a framework for uncertainty quantification (aleatoric and epistemic), useful in systems with inherent stochasticity.">

Previous benchmarking work has demonstrated it to be highly accurate for modeling dynamics in one-dimensional analytical models, but nonadiabatic dynamics often involves conical intersections, which are inherently two-dimensional. In this report, we assess the performance of TAB on two-dimensional models of cascades of conical intersections in dense manifolds of states. Several variants of TAB are considered, including TAB-w, which is based on the assumption of a Gaussian rather than exponential decay of the coherence, and TAB-DMS, which incorporates an efficient collapse procedure based on approximate eigenstates. Upon comparison to numerically exact quantum dynamics simulations, it is found that all TAB variants provide a suitable description of the dynamical passage through a cascade of conical intersections. The TAB-w approach is found to provide a somewhat more accurate description of population dynamics than the original TAB method, with final absolute population errors $\leq$0.013 in all cases. Even when only four approximate eigenstates are computed, the use of approximate eigenstates was found to introduce minimal additional error (absolute population error $\leq$0.018 in all models).">

 The growing time-series data make it possible to glimpse the hidden dynamics in various fields. However, developing a computational toolbox with high interpretability to unveil the interaction dynamics from data remains a crucial challenge. Here, we propose a new computational approach called Automated Dynamical Model Inference based on Expression Trees (ADMIET), in which the machine learning algorithm, the numerical integration of ordinary differential equations and the interpretability from prior knowledge are embedded into the symbolic learning scheme to establish a general framework for revealing the hidden dynamics in time-series data. ADMIET takes full advantage of both machine learning algorithm and expression tree. Firstly, we translate the prior knowledge into constraints on the structure of expression tree, reducing the search space and enhancing the interpretability. Secondly, we utilize the proposed adaptive penalty function to ensure the convergence of gradient descent algorithm and the selection of the symbols. Compared to gene expression programming, ADMIET exhibits its remarkable capability in function fitting with higher accuracy and broader applicability. Moreover, ADMIET can better fit parameters in nonlinear forms compared to regression methods. Furthermore, we apply ADMIET to two typical biological systems and one real data with different prior knowledge to infer the dynamical equations. The results indicate that ADMIET can not only discover the interaction relationships but also provide accurate estimates of the parameters in the equations. These results demonstrate ADMIET's superiority in revealing interpretable dynamics from time-series biological data.">

To address the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, the proposed low-rank method is cast in the framework of the hierarchical Tucker decomposition. The adaptive rank integrators we propose are built upon high-order discretizations for both time and space. In particular, this work considers implicit-explicit discretizations for time and finite-difference weighted-essentially non-oscillatory discretizations for space. The high-order singular value decomposition is used to perform low-rank truncation of the high-dimensional time-dependent distribution function. The methods are applied to several benchmark problems, where we compare the solution quality and measure compression achieved by the adaptive rank methods against their corresponding full-grid methods.

        <tr id="Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.">

This paper introduces the Fokker--Planck equation and employs partial data obtained through sampling to construct and visualize the effective loss landscape within a two-dimensional parameter space. This visualization reveals how the global minima in the loss landscape can transform into saddle points in the effective loss landscape, as well as the implicit bias of the semi-gradient method. Additionally, we demonstrate that saddle points, originating from the global minima in loss landscape, still exist in the effective loss landscape under high-dimensional parameter spaces and neural network settings.

        <tr id="Most existing theoretical investigations of the accuracy of diffusion models, albeit significant, assume the score function has been approximated to a certain accuracy, and then use this a priori bound to control the error of generation. This article instead provides a first quantitative understanding of the whole generation process, i.e., both training and sampling. More precisely, it conducts a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of denoising score matching under gradient descent. In addition, a refined sampling error analysis for variance exploding models is also provided. The combination of these two results yields a full error analysis, which elucidates (again, but this time theoretically) how to design the training and sampling processes for effective generation. For instance, our theory implies a preference toward noise distribution and loss weighting in training that qualitatively agree with the ones used in [Karras et al. 2022]. It also provides perspectives on the choices of time and variance schedules in sampling: when the score is well trained, the design in [Song et al. 2020] is more preferable, but when it is less trained, the design in [Karras et al. 2022] becomes more preferable.">

        <tr id="Elucidating the intricate relationship between the structure and dynamics in the context of the glass transition has been a persistent challenge. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a pivotal tool, offering novel pathways to predict dynamic behaviors from structural descriptors. Notably, recent research has highlighted that the distance between the initial particle positions between the equilibrium positions substantially enhances the prediction of glassy dynamics. However, these methodologies have been limited in their ability to capture the directional aspects of these deviations from the equilibrium positions, which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the complex particle interactions within the cage dynamics. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel structural parameter: the vectorial displacement of particles from their initial configuration to their equilibrium positions. Recognizing the inadequacy of current ML models in effectively handling such vectorial parameters, we have developed an Equivariance-Constrained Invariant Graph Neural Network (EIGNN). This innovative model not only bolsters the descriptive capacity of conventional rotation-invariant models but also streamlines the computational demands associated with rotation-equivariant graph neural networks. Our rigorous experimental validation on 3D glassy system from GlassBench dataset has yielded compelling evidence that the EIGNN model significantly enhance the correlation between structural representation and dynamic properties.">

        <tr id="Alchemical free energy methods are useful in computer-aided drug design and computational protein design because they provide rigorous statistical mechanics-based estimates of free energy differences from molecular dynamics simulations. λ dynamics is a free energy method with the ability to characterize combinatorial chemical spaces spanning thousands of related systems within a single simulation, which gives it a distinct advantage over other alchemical free energy methods that are mostly limited to pairwise comparisons. Recently developed methods have improved the scalability of λ dynamics to perturbations at many sites; however, the size of chemical space that can be explored at each individual site has previously been limited to fewer than ten substituents. As the number of substituents increases, the volume of alchemical space corresponding to nonphysical alchemical intermediates grows exponentially relative to the size corresponding to the physical states of interest. Beyond nine substituents, λ dynamics simulations become lost in an alchemical morass of intermediate states. In this work, we introduce new biasing potentials that circumvent excessive sampling of intermediate states by favoring sampling of physical end points relative to alchemical intermediates. Additionally, we present a more scalable adaptive landscape flattening algorithm for these larger alchemical spaces. Finally, we show that this potential enables more efficient sampling in both protein and drug design test systems with up to 24 substituents per site, enabling, for the first time, simultaneous simulation of all 20 amino acids.">

Traditional methods for identifying self-similarity often rely on specific models, which can introduce significant bias. In this paper, we present a novel neural network-based approach that discovers self-similarity directly from observed data, without presupposing any models. The presence of self-similar solutions in a physical problem signals that the governing law contains a function whose arguments are given by power-law monomials of physical parameters, which are characterized by power-law exponents. The basic idea is to enforce such particular forms structurally in a neural network in a parametrized way. We train the neural network model using the observed data, and when the training is successful, we can extract the power exponents that characterize scale-transformation symmetries of the physical problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both synthetic and experimental data, validating its potential as a robust, model-independent tool for exploring self-similarity in complex systems.">

This has received significant attention recently under different types of assumptions on the model parameters. The setting we consider involves a collection of $m$ linear systems each of which resides on a node of a given undirected graph $G = ([m], \mathcal{E})$. We assume that the system matrices are marginally stable, and satisfy a smoothness constraint w.r.t $G$ -- akin to the quadratic variation of a signal on a graph. Given access to the states of the nodes over $T$ time points, we then propose two estimators for joint estimation of the system matrices, along with non-asymptotic error bounds on the mean-squared error (MSE). In particular, we show conditions under which the MSE converges to zero as $m$ increases, typically polynomially fast w.r.t $m$. The results hold under mild (i.e., $T \sim \log m$), or sometimes, even no assumption on $T$ (i.e. $T \geq 2$).">

The Lagrangian formulation alone is insufficient to fully capture the holistic behavior of the system. Coupling and dissipation mechanisms play a pivotal role in shaping the system's response. Consequently, to effectively capture the dynamics of inter-coupled electro-mechanical systems with dissipation, we propose an extended Lagrangian-informed deep neural network framework in this paper. Our approach leverages the underlying physics-based knowledge of the system, incorporating it into the neural network architecture. By employing the Euler-Lagrange equations as constraints in the training process, we ensure that the learned dynamics conform to the true behavior of the system. To validate the theoretical framework, we conduct simulation experiments on a DC motor with a cart system, which serves as a representative model of dissipative nonlinear electro-mechanical systems. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in accurately capturing and integrating the dynamics to solve the reference tracking model predictive control design.">

Each component of MSSMs is associated with each cluster. An advantage of the proposed method is that it enables the use of time series models appropriate to the specific time series. This not only improves clustering and prediction accuracy but also enhances the interpretability of the estimated parameters. The parameters of the MSSMs are estimated using stochastic variational inference, a subtype of variational inference. The proposed method estimates the latent variables of an arbitrary state space model by using neural networks with a normalizing flow as a variational estimator. The number of clusters can be estimated using the Bayesian information criterion. In addition, to prevent MSSMs from converging to the local optimum, we propose several optimization tricks, including an additional penalty term called entropy annealing. Experiments on simulated datasets show that the proposed method is effective for clustering, parameter estimation, and estimating the number of clusters.">

These choices of the penalty term are contingent upon the specific architecture of the neural network being utilized. We establish the connection between various network norms and particularly trace the dependence of the dimensionality index, aiming to deepen our understanding of how these norms interplay with each other.

This study leverages the reservoir computing framework to address this problem by unsupervised extraction of slowly varying system parameters from time series data. We propose a model architecture consisting of a slow reservoir with long timescale internal dynamics and a fast reservoir with short timescale dynamics. The slow reservoir extracts the temporal variation of system parameters, which are then used to predict unknown bifurcations in the fast dynamics. Through experiments using data generated from chaotic dynamical systems, we demonstrate the ability to predict bifurcations not present in the training data. Our approach shows potential for applications in fields such as neuroscience, material science, and weather prediction, where slow dynamics influencing qualitative changes are often unobservable.">

        <tr id="We present a maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) approach for improving the sample quality of diffusion generative models, especially when the number of generation time steps is small. Similar to how IRL trains a policy based on the reward function learned from expert demonstrations, we train (or fine-tune) a diffusion model using the log probability density estimated from training data. Since we employ an energy-based model (EBM) to represent the log density, our approach boils down to the joint training of a diffusion model and an EBM. Our IRL formulation, named Diffusion by Maximum Entropy IRL (DxMI), is a minimax problem that reaches equilibrium when both models converge to the data distribution. The entropy maximization plays a key role in DxMI, facilitating the exploration of the diffusion model and ensuring the convergence of the EBM. We also propose Diffusion by Dynamic Programming (DxDP), a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for diffusion models, as a subroutine in DxMI. DxDP makes the diffusion model update in DxMI efficient by transforming the original problem into an optimal control formulation where value functions replace back-propagation in time. Our empirical studies show that diffusion models fine-tuned using DxMI can generate high-quality samples in as few as 4 and 10 steps. Additionally, DxMI enables the training of an EBM without MCMC, stabilizing EBM training dynamics and enhancing anomaly detection performance.">

The results demonstrate that the temporal evolution of O-atom density predicted by both the FNN and the 0D model aligns closely with the measurements obtained from the fast ionization wave discharge. Furthermore, the differences in O-atom density between the predictions and measurements are the same order of magnitude.

Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, excelling at unconditional sample generation and, with data-driven guidance, conditional generation within their training domain. Reliably sampling from high-value regions beyond the training data, however, remains an open challenge -- with current methods predominantly focusing on modifying the diffusion process itself. In this paper, we develop context-guided diffusion (CGD), a simple plug-and-play method that leverages unlabeled data and smoothness constraints to improve the out-of-distribution generalization of guided diffusion models. We demonstrate that this approach leads to substantial performance gains across various settings, including continuous, discrete, and graph-structured diffusion processes with applications across drug discovery, materials science, and protein design.">

        <tr id="A common technique for ameliorating the computational costs of running large neural models is sparsification, or the removal of neural connections during training. Sparse models are capable of maintaining the high accuracy of state of the art models, while functioning at the cost of more parsimonious models. The structures which underlie sparse architectures are, however, poorly understood and not consistent between differently trained models and sparsification schemes. In this paper, we propose a new technique for sparsification of recurrent neural nets (RNNs), called moduli regularization, in combination with magnitude pruning. Moduli regularization leverages the dynamical system induced by the recurrent structure to induce a geometric relationship between neurons in the hidden state of the RNN. By making our regularizing term explicitly geometric, we provide the first, to our knowledge, a priori description of the desired sparse architecture of our neural net. We verify the effectiveness of our scheme for navigation and natural language processing RNNs. Navigation is a structurally geometric task, for which there are known moduli spaces, and we show that regularization can be used to reach 90% sparsity while maintaining model performance only when coefficients are chosen in accordance with a suitable moduli space. Natural language processing, however, has no known moduli space in which computations are performed. Nevertheless, we show that moduli regularization induces more stable recurrent neural nets with a variety of moduli regularizers, and achieves high fidelity models at 98% sparsity.">

        <tr id="Deep learning with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) has emerged as a highly popular and effective approach for solving partial differential equations(PDEs). In this paper, we first investigate the extrapolation capability of the PINN method for time-dependent PDEs. Taking advantage of this extrapolation property, we can generalize the training result obtained in the time subinterval to the large interval by adding a correction term to the network parameters of the subinterval. The correction term is determined by further training with the sample points in the added subinterval. Secondly, by designing an extrapolation control function with special characteristics and combining it with the correction term, we construct a new neural network architecture whose network parameters are coupled with the time variable, which we call the extrapolation-driven network architecture. Based on this architecture, using a single neural network, we can obtain the overall PINN solution of the whole domain with the following two characteristics: (1) it completely inherits the local solution of the interval obtained from the previous training, (2) at the interval node, it strictly maintains the continuity and smoothness that the true solution has. The extrapolation-driven network architecture allows us to divide a large time domain into multiple subintervals and solve the time-dependent PDEs one by one in chronological order. This training scheme respects the causality principle and effectively overcomes the difficulties of the conventional PINN method in solving the evolution equation on a large time domain. Numerical experiments verify the performance of our proposed method.">

Unfortunately, the problem is generally ill-posed due to the possible presence of unknown delays in the measurements. In this paper, we offer a solution of this problem by using a variational Bayes framework, where the uncertainty over the delays is marginalized in order to obtain conservative coupling estimates. To overcome the well-known overconfidence of classical variational methods, we use a hybrid-VI scheme where the (possibly flat or multimodal) posterior over the measurement parameters is estimated using a forward KL loss while the (nearly convex) conditional posterior over the couplings is estimated using the highly scalable gradient-based VI. In our ground-truth experiments, we show that the network provides reliable and conservative estimates of the couplings, greatly outperforming similar methods such as regression DCM.">

        <tr id="In the present work we report an implementation of the rank-reduced equation-of-motion coupled cluster method with approximate triple excitations (RR-EOM-CC3). The proposed variant relies on tensor decomposition techniques in order to alleviate the high cost of computing and manipulating the triply-excited amplitudes. In the RR-EOM-CC3 method, both ground-state and excited-state triple-excitation amplitudes are compressed according to the Tucker-3 format. This enables to factorize the working equations such that the formal scaling of the method is reduced to $N^6$, where $N$ is the system size. An additional advantage of our method is the fact the accuracy can be strictly controlled by proper choice of two parameters defining sizes of triple-excitation subspaces in the Tucker decomposition for the ground and excited states. Optimal strategies of selecting these parameters are discussed. The developed method has been tested in a series of calculations of electronic excitation energies and compared to its canonical EOM-CC3 counterpart. Errors several times smaller than the inherent error of the canonical EOM-CC3 method (in comparison to FCI) are straightforward to achieve. This conclusion holds both for valence states dominated by single excitations and for states with pronounced doubly-excited character. Taking advantage of the decreased scaling, we demonstrate substantial computational costs reductions (in comparison with the canonical EOM-CC3) in the case of two large molecules -- L-proline and heptazine. This illustrates the usefulness of the RR-EOM-CC3 method for accurate determination of excitation energies of large molecules.">

However, a critical challenge lies in determining the appropriate number of underlying states, often unknown in practice. In this paper, we employ a Bayesian framework, treating the number of states as a random variable and employing reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo to sample from the posterior distributions of all parameters, including the number of states. Additionally, we introduce repulsive priors for the state parameters in HMMs, and hence avoid overfitting issues and promote parsimonious models with dissimilar state components. We perform an extensive simulation study comparing performance of models with independent and repulsive prior distributions on the state parameters, and demonstrate our proposed framework on two ecological case studies: GPS tracking data on muskox in Antarctica and acoustic data on Cape gannets in South Africa. Our results highlight how our framework effectively explores the model space, defined by models with different latent state dimensions, while leading to latent states that are distinguished better and hence are more interpretable, enabling better understanding of complex dynamic systems.">

Motivated by connections to numerical integration and physics-informed neural networks, we explicitly derive the physics-informed NVAR (piNVAR) which enforces the right-hand side of the underlying differential equation regardless of NVAR construction. Because NVAR and piNVAR completely share their learned parameters, we propose an augmented procedure to jointly train the two models. Then, using both data-driven and ODE-driven metrics, we evaluate the ability of the piNVAR model to predict solutions to various ODE systems, such as the undamped spring, a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey nonlinear model, and the chaotic Lorenz system.">

        <tr id="Online prediction of time series under regime switching is a widely studied problem in the literature, with many celebrated approaches. Using the non-parametric flexibility of Gaussian processes, the recently proposed INTEL algorithm provides a product of experts approach to online prediction of time series under possible regime switching, including the special case of outliers. This is achieved by adaptively combining several candidate models, each reporting their predictive distribution at time $t$. However, the INTEL algorithm uses a finite context window approximation to the predictive distribution, the computation of which scales cubically with the maximum lag, or otherwise scales quartically with exact predictive distributions. We introduce LINTEL, which uses the exact filtering distribution at time $t$ with constant-time updates, making the time complexity of the streaming algorithm optimal. We additionally note that the weighting mechanism of INTEL is better suited to a mixture of experts approach, and propose a fusion policy based on arithmetic averaging for LINTEL. We show experimentally that our proposed approach is over five times faster than INTEL under reasonable settings with better quality predictions.">

        <tr id="Networks in machine learning offer examples of complex high-dimensional dynamical systems inspired by and reminiscent of biological systems. Here, we study the learning dynamics of generalized Hopfield networks, which permit visualization of internal memories. These networks have been shown to proceed through a “feature-to-prototype” transition, as the strength of network nonlinearity is increased, wherein the learned, or terminal, states of internal memories transition from mixed to pure states. Focusing on the prototype learning dynamics of the internal memories, we observe stereotypical dynamics of memories wherein similar subgroups of memories sequentially split at well-defined saddles. The splitting order is interpretable and reproducible from one simulation to the other. The dynamics prior to splits are robust to variations in many features of the system. To develop a more rigorous understanding of these global dynamics, we study smaller subsystems that exhibit similar properties to the full system. Within these smaller systems, we combine analytical calculations with numerical simulations to study the dynamics of the feature-to-prototype transition, and the emergence of saddle points in the learning landscape. We exhibit regimes where saddles appear and disappear through saddle-node bifurcations, qualitatively changing the distribution of learned memories as the strength of the nonlinearity is varied—allowing us to systematically investigate the mechanisms that underlie the emergence of the learning dynamics. Several features of the learning dynamics are reminiscent of the Waddington's caricature of cellular differentiation, and we attempt to make this analogy more precise. Memories can thus differentiate in a predictive and controlled way, revealing bridges between experimental biology, dynamical systems theory, and machine learning.

        <tr id="This paper examines the alignment of inductive biases in machine learning (ML) with structural models of economic dynamics. Unlike dynamical systems found in physical and life sciences, economics models are often specified by differential equations with a mixture of easy-to-enforce initial conditions and hard-to-enforce infinite horizon boundary conditions (e.g. transversality and no-ponzi-scheme conditions). Traditional methods for enforcing these constraints are computationally expensive and unstable. We investigate algorithms where those infinite horizon constraints are ignored, simply training unregularized kernel machines and neural networks to obey the differential equations. Despite the inherent underspecification of this approach, our findings reveal that the inductive biases of these ML models innately enforce the infinite-horizon conditions necessary for the well-posedness. We theoretically demonstrate that (approximate or exact) min-norm ML solutions to interpolation problems are sufficient conditions for these infinite-horizon boundary conditions in a wide class of problems. We then provide empirical evidence that deep learning and ridgeless kernel methods are not only theoretically sound with respect to economic assumptions, but may even dominate classic algorithms in low to medium dimensions. More importantly, these results give confidence that, despite solving seemingly ill-posed problems, there are reasons to trust the plethora of black-box ML algorithms used by economists to solve previously intractable, high-dimensional dynamical systems -- paving the way for future work on estimation of inverse problems with embedded optimal control problems.">

        <tr id="We propose a framework to perform Bayesian inference using conditional score-based diffusion models to solve a class of inverse problems in mechanics involving the inference of a specimen's spatially varying material properties from noisy measurements of its mechanical response to loading. Conditional score-based diffusion models are generative models that learn to approximate the score function of a conditional distribution using samples from the joint distribution. More specifically, the score functions corresponding to multiple realizations of the measurement are approximated using a single neural network, the so-called score network, which is subsequently used to sample the posterior distribution using an appropriate Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme based on Langevin dynamics. Training the score network only requires simulating the forward model. Hence, the proposed approach can accommodate black-box forward models and complex measurement noise. Moreover, once the score network has been trained, it can be re-used to solve the inverse problem for different realizations of the measurements. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach on a suite of high-dimensional inverse problems in mechanics that involve inferring heterogeneous material properties from noisy measurements. Some examples we consider involve synthetic data, while others include data collected from actual elastography experiments. Further, our applications demonstrate that the proposed approach can handle different measurement modalities, complex patterns in the inferred quantities, non-Gaussian and non-additive noise models, and nonlinear black-box forward models. The results show that the proposed framework can solve large-scale physics-based inverse problems efficiently.">

Here, we present a practical overview of the recently introduced Laplacian Renormalization Group for heterogeneous networks. First, we present a brief overview that justifies the use of the Laplacian as a natural extension for well-known field theories to analyze spatial disorder. We then draw an analogy to traditional real-space renormalization group procedures, explaining how the LRG generalizes the concept of"Kadanoff supernodes"as block nodes that span multiple scales. These supernodes help mitigate the effects of cross-scale correlations due to small-world properties. Additionally, we rigorously define the LRG procedure in momentum space in the spirit of Wilson RG. Finally, we show different analyses for the evolution of network properties along the LRG flow following structural changes when the network is properly reduced.">

        <tr id="The prediction of time series is a challenging task relevant in such diverse applications as analyzing financial data, forecasting flow dynamics or understanding biological processes. Especially chaotic time series that depend on a long history pose an exceptionally difficult problem. While machine learning has shown to be a promising approach for predicting such time series, it either demands long training time and much training data when using deep recurrent neural networks. Alternative, when using a reservoir computing approach it comes with high uncertainty and typically a high number of random initializations and extensive hyper-parameter tuning when using a reservoir computing approach. In this paper, we focus on the reservoir computing approach and propose a new mapping of input data into the reservoir's state space. Furthermore, we incorporate this method in two novel network architectures increasing parallelizability, depth and predictive capabilities of the neural network while reducing the dependence on randomness. For the evaluation, we approximate a set of time series from the Mackey-Glass equation, inhabiting non-chaotic as well as chaotic behavior and compare our approaches in regard to their predictive capabilities to echo state networks and gated recurrent units. For the chaotic time series, we observe an error reduction of up to $85.45\%$ and up to $87.90\%$ in contrast to echo state networks and gated recurrent units respectively. Furthermore, we also observe tremendous improvements for non-chaotic time series of up to $99.99\%$ in contrast to existing approaches.">

        <tr id="Modeling dynamical systems is a fundamental task in scientific and engineering fields, often accomplished by applying theory-based models with mathematical equations. Yet, in cases where these equations cannot be established or parameterized properly, theory-based models are not applicable. Instead, a viable alternative is to learn the system dynamics directly from data, for example with deep learning models. However, traditional deep learning models often produce physically inconsistent results and struggle to generalize to unseen data, especially when training data is limited. One solution to this shortcoming is knowledge-guided deep learning, leveraging prior knowledge about the expected behavior of a dynamical system. In this work, we identify and formalize permissible system states, a novel type of prior knowledge that is often available for systems in the context of temporal dynamics modeling. This prior knowledge describes dynamic states that the system is allowed to take during its operation. We propose a knowledge-guided multi-state constraint to encode this type of prior knowledge through a loss function, making it applicable to any deep learning model. This approach allows to create an accurate data-driven model with minimal effort and data requirements. We validate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to model the temporal behavior of a gas turbine in response to an input control signal. Our results indicate that the proposed method reduces the prediction error by up to 40%. In addition to reducing the dependency on extensive training data, our method mitigates training randomness and enhances the consistency of predictions with the expected behavior.">

        <tr id="Predicting the dynamics of turbulent fluid flows has long been a central goal of science and engineering. Yet, even with modern computing technology, accurate simulation of all but the simplest turbulent flow-fields remains impossible: the fields are too chaotic and multi-scaled to directly store them in memory and perform time-evolution. An alternative is to treat turbulence $\textit{probabilistically}$, viewing flow properties as random variables distributed according to joint probability density functions (PDFs). Turbulence PDFs are neither chaotic nor multi-scale, but are still challenging to simulate due to their high dimensionality. Here we show how to overcome the dimensionality problem by parameterising turbulence PDFs into an extremely compressed format known as a"tensor network"(TN). The TN paradigm enables simulations on single CPU cores that would otherwise be impractical even with supercomputers: for a $5+1$ dimensional PDF of a chemically reactive turbulent flow, we achieve reductions in memory and computational costs by factors of $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$, respectively, compared to standard finite difference algorithms. A future path is opened towards something heretofore regarded as infeasible: directly simulating high-dimensional PDFs of both turbulent flows and other chaotic systems that are useful to describe probabilistically.">

The recently released version of the Martini CG force field (Martini 3) has been successfully applied to simulate many processes, including protein-ligand binding. However, the current ligand parametrization scheme is manual and requires an a priori reference all-atom (AA) simulation for benchmarking. For systems with suboptimal AA parameters, which are often unknown, this translates into a CG model that does not reproduce the true dynamical behavior of the underlying molecule. Here, we present Bartender, a quantum mechanics (QM)/MD-based parametrization tool written in Go. Bartender harnesses the power of QM simulations and produces reasonable bonded terms for Martini 3 CG models of small molecules in an efficient and user-friendly manner. For small, ring-like molecules, Bartender generates models whose properties are indistinguishable from the human-made models. For more complex, drug-like ligands, it is able to fit functional forms beyond simple harmonic dihedrals and thus better captures their dynamical behavior. Bartender has the power to both increase the efficiency and the accuracy of Martini 3-based high-throughput applications by producing numerically stable and physically realistic CG models.">

 Continuous-time Markov chains are frequently used to model the stochastic dynamics of (bio)chemical reaction networks. However, except in very special cases, they cannot be analyzed exactly. Additionally, simulation can be computationally intensive. An approach to address these challenges is to consider a more tractable diffusion approximation. Leite and Williams (Ann. Appl. Prob.29, 2019) proposed a reflected diffusion as an approximation for (bio)chemical reaction networks, which they called the constrained Langevin approximation (CLA) as it extends the usual Langevin approximation beyond the first time some chemical species becomes zero in number. Further explanation and examples of the CLA can be found in Anderson et al. (SIAM Multiscale Modeling Simul.17, 2019).
 In this paper, we extend the approximation of Leite and Williams to (nearly) density-dependent Markov chains, as a first step to obtaining error estimates for the CLA when the diffusion state space is one-dimensional, and we provide a bound for the error in a strong approximation. We discuss some applications for chemical reaction networks and epidemic models, and illustrate these with examples. Our method of proof is designed to generalize to higher dimensions, provided there is a Lipschitz Skorokhod map defining the reflected diffusion process. The existence of such a Lipschitz map is an open problem in dimensions more than one.">

        <tr id="The dynamics of biological systems, from proteins to cells to organisms, is complex and stochastic. To decipher their physical laws, we need to bridge between experimental observations and theoretical modeling. Thanks to progress in microscopy and tracking, there is today an abundance of experimental trajectories reflecting these dynamical laws. Inferring physical models from noisy and imperfect experimental data, however, is challenging. Because there are no inference methods that are robust and efficient, model reconstruction from experimental trajectories is a bottleneck to data-driven biophysics. In this Thesis, I present a set of tools developed to bridge this gap and permit robust and universal inference of stochastic dynamical models from experimental trajectories. These methods are rooted in an information-theoretical framework that quantifies how much can be inferred from trajectories that are short, partial and noisy. They permit the efficient inference of dynamical models for overdamped and underdamped Langevin systems, as well as the inference of entropy production rates. I finally present early applications of these techniques, as well as future research directions.">

In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework to investigate the separation power of equivariant neural networks with point-wise activations. Using the proposed framework, we can derive an explicit description of inputs indistinguishable by a family of neural networks with given architecture, demonstrating that it remains unaffected by the choice of non-polynomial activation function employed. We are able to understand the role played by activation functions in separability. Indeed, we show that all non-polynomial activations, such as ReLU and sigmoid, are equivalent in terms of expressivity, and that they reach maximum discrimination capacity. We demonstrate how assessing the separation power of an equivariant neural network can be simplified to evaluating the separation power of minimal representations. We conclude by illustrating how these minimal components form a hierarchy in separation power.">

Recently, local structural variables identified using machine learning, such as"softness", have emerged as predictors of local dynamics. Here we construct a model using softness to describe the structural origins of dynamical heterogeneity in supercooled liquids. In our model, the probability of particles to rearrange is determined by their softness, and each rearrangement induces changes in the softness of nearby particles, describing facilitation. We show how to ensure that these changes respect the underlying time-reversal symmetry of the liquid's dynamics. The model reproduces the salient features of dynamical heterogeneity, and demonstrates how long-ranged dynamical correlations can emerge at long time scales from a relatively short softness correlation length.">

To learn the laws of systems, all previous methods for equation discovery in hybrid systems follow a two-stage paradigm, i.e. they first group time series into small cluster fragments and then discover equations in each fragment separately through methods in non-hybrid systems. Although effective, these methods do not fully take advantage of the commonalities in the shared dynamics of multiple fragments that are driven by the same equations. Besides, the two-stage paradigm breaks the interdependence between categorizing and representing dynamics that jointly form hybrid systems. In this paper, we reformulate the problem and propose an end-to-end learning framework, i.e. Amortized Equation Discovery (AMORE), to jointly categorize modes and discover equations characterizing the dynamics of each mode by all segments of the mode. Experiments on four hybrid and six non-hybrid systems show that our method outperforms previous methods on equation discovery, segmentation, and forecasting.">

The majority of dynamical systems arising from applications show a chaotic character. This is especially true for climate and weather applications. We present here an application of Koopman operator theory to tropical and global SST that yields an approximation to the continuous spectrum typical of these situations. We also show that the Koopman modes yield a decomposition of the data sets that can be used to categorize the variability. Most relevant modes emerge naturally and they can be identified easily. A difference with other analysis methods such as EOF or Fourier expansion is that the Koopman modes have a dynamical interpretation thanks to their connection to the Koopman operator and they are not constrained in their shape by special requirements such as orthogonality (as it is the case for EOF) or pure periodicity (as in the case of Fourier expansions). The pure periodic modes emerge naturally and they form a subspace that can be interpreted as the limiting subspace for the variability. The stationary states therefore are the scaffolding around which the dynamics takes place. The modes can also be traced to the NINO variability and in the case of the global SST to the PDO.">

So far, much of this work focused on theoretical foundations, and as such is not particularly data efficient or scalable.

Recent work has pushed the bounds of universal approximation by showing that arbitrary functions can similarly be learned by tuning smaller subsets of parameters, for example the output weights, within randomly initialized networks. Motivated by the fact that biases can be interpreted as biologically plausible mechanisms for adjusting unit outputs in neural networks, such as tonic inputs or activation thresholds, we investigate the expressivity of neural networks with random weights where only biases are optimized. We provide theoretical and numerical evidence demonstrating that feedforward neural networks with fixed random weights can be trained to perform multiple tasks by learning biases only. We further show that an equivalent result holds for recurrent neural networks predicting dynamical system trajectories. Our results are relevant to neuroscience, where they demonstrate the potential for behaviourally relevant changes in dynamics without modifying synaptic weights, as well as for AI, where they shed light on multi-task methods such as bias fine-tuning and unit masking.">

We prove nonasymptotic bounds for the parameter estimates produced by multiple algorithms in the strongly log-concave setting and provide comprehensive numerical experiments on various models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. In particular, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed family of algorithms on a toy hierarchical example where our assumptions can be checked, as well as on the problems of sparse Bayesian logistic regression, sparse Bayesian neural network, and sparse matrix completion. Our theory and experiments together show that PIPLA family can be the de facto choice for parameter estimation problems in latent variable models for non-differentiable models.">

        <tr id="We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. Using the FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations among subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations among subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the 'explicit' dynamics of the object with an 'implicit' flow on free energy gradients - a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.">

        <tr id="Accurate estimate of long-term risk is critical for safe decision-making, but sampling from rare risk events and long-term trajectories can be prohibitively costly. Risk gradient can be used in many first-order techniques for learning and control methods, but gradient estimate is difficult to obtain using Monte Carlo (MC) methods because the infinitesimal divisor may significantly amplify sampling noise. Motivated by this gap, we propose an efficient method to evaluate long-term risk probabilities and their gradients using short-term samples without sufficient risk events. We first derive that four types of long-term risk probability are solutions of certain partial differential equations (PDEs). Then, we propose a physics-informed learning technique that integrates data and physics information (aforementioned PDEs). The physics information helps propagate information beyond available data and obtain provable generalization beyond available data, which in turn enables long-term risk to be estimated using short-term samples of safe events. Finally, we demonstrate in simulation that the proposed technique has improved sample efficiency, generalizes well to unseen regions, and adapts to changing system parameters.">

        <tr id="We introduce a novel generative model for the representation of joint probability distributions of a possibly large number of discrete random variables. The approach uses measure transport by randomized assignment flows on the statistical submanifold of factorizing distributions, which also enables to sample efficiently from the target distribution and to assess the likelihood of unseen data points. The embedding of the flow via the Segre map in the meta-simplex of all discrete joint distributions ensures that any target distribution can be represented in principle, whose complexity in practice only depends on the parametrization of the affinity function of the dynamical assignment flow system. Our model can be trained in a simulation-free manner without integration by conditional Riemannian flow matching, using the training data encoded as geodesics in closed-form with respect to the e-connection of information geometry. By projecting high-dimensional flow matching in the meta-simplex of joint distributions to the submanifold of factorizing distributions, our approach has strong motivation from first principles of modeling coupled discrete variables. Numerical experiments devoted to distributions of structured image labelings demonstrate the applicability to large-scale problems, which may include discrete distributions in other application areas. Performance measures show that our approach scales better with the increasing number of classes than recent related work.">

 Machine learning approaches have recently emerged as powerful tools to probe structure-property relationships in crystals and molecules. Specifically, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can accurately reproduce first-principles data at a cost similar to that of conventional interatomic potential approaches. While MLIPs have been extensively tested across various classes of materials and molecules, a clear characterization of the anharmonic terms encoded in the MLIPs is lacking. Here, we benchmark popular MLIPs using the anharmonic vibrational Hamiltonian of ThO2 in the fluorite crystal structure, which was constructed from density functional theory (DFT) using our highly accurate and efficient irreducible derivative methods. The anharmonic Hamiltonian was used to generate molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories, which were used to train three classes of MLIPs: Gaussian Approximation Potentials, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). The results were assessed by directly comparing phonons and their interactions, as well as phonon linewidths, phonon lineshifts, and thermal conductivity. The models were also trained on a DFT molecular dynamics dataset, demonstrating good agreement up to fifth-order for the ANN and GNN. Our analysis demonstrates that MLIPs have great potential for accurately characterizing anharmonicity in materials systems at a fraction of the cost of conventional first principles-based approaches.">

        <tr id="Diffusion models have emerged as effective distribution estimators in vision, language, and reinforcement learning, but their use as priors in downstream tasks poses an intractable posterior inference problem. This paper studies amortized sampling of the posterior over data, $\mathbf{x}\sim p^{\rm post}(\mathbf{x})\propto p(\mathbf{x})r(\mathbf{x})$, in a model that consists of a diffusion generative model prior $p(\mathbf{x})$ and a black-box constraint or likelihood function $r(\mathbf{x})$. We state and prove the asymptotic correctness of a data-free learning objective, relative trajectory balance, for training a diffusion model that samples from this posterior, a problem that existing methods solve only approximately or in restricted cases. Relative trajectory balance arises from the generative flow network perspective on diffusion models, which allows the use of deep reinforcement learning techniques to improve mode coverage. Experiments illustrate the broad potential of unbiased inference of arbitrary posteriors under diffusion priors: in vision (classifier guidance), language (infilling under a discrete diffusion LLM), and multimodal data (text-to-image generation). Beyond generative modeling, we apply relative trajectory balance to the problem of continuous control with a score-based behavior prior, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks in offline reinforcement learning.">

This paper proposes a residual-based multipeaks adaptive sampling (RMAS) algorithm, which can reduce the demand for a large number of samples in the identification of stochastic dynamical systems. Compared to classical residual-based sampling algorithms, the RMAS algorithm achieves higher system identification accuracy without relying on any hyperparameters. Subsequently, combining the RMAS algorithm and neural network, a few-shot identification (FSI) method for stochastic dynamical systems is proposed, which is applied to the identification of a vegetation biomass change model and the Rayleigh-Van der Pol impact vibration model. We show that the RMAS algorithm modifies residual-based sampling algorithms and, in particular, reduces the system identification error by 76% with the same sample sizes. Moreover, the surrogate model accurately predicts the first escape probability density function and the P bifurcation behavior in the systems, with the error of less than 1.59×10-2. Finally, the robustness of the FSI method is validated.">

The learnt prior knowledge helps the model to capture complex temporal dynamics and the inherent uncertainty of the data. This improves its ability to model highly stochastic time series data. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model on stochastic time series forecasting.

        <tr id="We study the problem of non-convex optimization using Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD). SGLD is a natural and popular variation of stochastic gradient descent where at each step, appropriately scaled Gaussian noise is added. To our knowledge, the only strategy for showing global convergence of SGLD on the loss function is to show that SGLD can sample from a stationary distribution which assigns larger mass when the function is small (the Gibbs measure), and then to convert these guarantees to optimization results. We employ a new strategy to analyze the convergence of SGLD to global minima, based on Lyapunov potentials and optimization. We convert the same mild conditions from previous works on SGLD into geometric properties based on Lyapunov potentials. This adapts well to the case with a stochastic gradient oracle, which is natural for machine learning applications where one wants to minimize population loss but only has access to stochastic gradients via minibatch training samples. Here we provide 1) improved rates in the setting of previous works studying SGLD for optimization, 2) the first finite gradient complexity guarantee for SGLD where the function is Lipschitz and the Gibbs measure defined by the function satisfies a Poincar\'e Inequality, and 3) prove if continuous-time Langevin Dynamics succeeds for optimization, then discrete-time SGLD succeeds under mild regularity assumptions.">

Then, in the prior dimensionality reduced subspace, we correct the inaccurate mode coefficients and restore the discarded mode coefficients through neural network. Finally, we approximate the solutions with these mode coefficients in the prior dimensionality reduced subspace. To reduce the computational cost during the offline training stage, we propose a training data sampling strategy based on dynamic mode decomposition (DMD).

While there are theorems and a well-established toolbox for systems in thermal equilibrium, much less is known about the role of symmetries and their connection to dynamics out of equilibrium. This arises due to the direct link between a system's thermal state and its Hamiltonian, which is generally not the case for nonequilibrium dynamics. Here we present a pathway to identify the effective symmetries and to extract them from data in nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems. Our approach is based on exact relations between correlation functions involving different numbers of spatial points, which can be viewed as nonequilibrium versions of (equal-time) Ward identities encoding the symmetries of the system. We derive symmetry witnesses, which are particularly suitable for the analysis of measured or simulated data at different snapshots in time. To demonstrate the potential of the approach, we apply our method to numerical and experimental data for a spinor Bose gas. We investigate the important question of a dynamical restoration of an explicitly broken symmetry of the Hamiltonian by the initial state. Remarkably, it is found that effective symmetry restoration can occur long before the system equilibrates. We also use the approach to define and identify spontaneous symmetry breaking far from equilibrium, which is of great relevance for applications to nonequilibrium phase transitions. Our work opens new avenues for the classification and analysis of quantum as well as classical many-body dynamics in a large variety of systems, ranging from ultracold quantum gases to cosmology.">

However, these methods still are prone to scarcity problems where per-environment data is sparse or limited. Therefore, we propose a novel CoNDP (Context-Informed Neural ODE Processes) to achieve learning system dynamics from sparse observations across environments. It can fully use contextual information of each environment to better capture the intrinsic commonalities across environments and distinguishable differences among environments while modeling uncertainty of system evolution, producing more accurate predictions. Intensive experiments are conducted on five complex dynamical systems in various fields.

We derive a ``Kirchhoff's law"for the probability current in the adiabatic limit, from which the optimal kinetic rates are determined analytically for any given probability trajectory. By using the optimal rates, we show that the total dissipation is determined by a $L_2$-distance measure in the probability space and derive an analytical expression for the metric tensor that depends on the probability distribution, network topology, and capacity of each link. Minimizing the total dissipation leads to the geodesic trajectory in the probability space and the corresponding OC protocol is determined by the Kirchhoff's law. To demonstrate our general approach, we use it to find a lower bound for the minimum dissipation that is tighter than existing bounds obtained with only global constraints. We also apply it to simple networks, e.g., fully connected 3-state CRNs with different local constraints and show that indirect pathway and non-functional transient state can play a crucial role in switching between different probability distributions efficiently. Future directions in studying OC in CRNs by using our general framework are discussed.">

        <tr id="Single-cell time series data frequently display considerable variability across a cell population. The current gold standard for inferring parameter distributions across cell populations is the Global Two Stage (GTS) approach for nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) models. However, this method is computationally intensive, as it makes repeated use of non-convex optimization that in turn requires numerical integration of the underlying system. Here, we propose the Gradient Matching GTS (GMGTS) method as an efficient alternative to GTS. Gradient matching offers an integration-free approach to parameter estimation that is particularly powerful for dynamical systems that are linear in the unknown parameters, such as biochemical networks modeled by mass action kinetics. Here, we harness the power of gradient matching by integrating it into the GTS framework. To this end, we significantly expand the capabilities of gradient matching via uncertainty propagation calculations and the development of an iterative estimation scheme for partially observed systems. Through comparisons of GMGTS with GTS in different inference setups, we demonstrate that our method provides a significant computational advantage, thereby facilitating the use of complex NLME models in systems biology applications.">

        <tr id="With the increasing prevalence of probabilistic programming languages, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has become the mainstay of applied Bayesian inference. However HMC still struggles to sample from densities with multiscale geometry: a large step size is needed to efficiently explore low curvature regions while a small step size is needed to accurately explore high curvature regions. We introduce the delayed rejection generalized HMC (DR-G-HMC) sampler that overcomes this challenge by employing dynamic step size selection, inspired by differential equation solvers. In a single sampling iteration, DR-G-HMC sequentially makes proposals with geometrically decreasing step sizes if necessary. This simulates Hamiltonian dynamics with increasing fidelity that, in high curvature regions, generates proposals with a higher chance of acceptance. DR-G-HMC also makes generalized HMC competitive by decreasing the number of rejections which otherwise cause inefficient backtracking and prevents directed movement. We present experiments to demonstrate that DR-G-HMC (1) correctly samples from multiscale densities, (2) makes generalized HMC methods competitive with the state of the art No-U-Turn sampler, and (3) is robust to tuning parameters.">

For this specific example, the output uncertainty arising from uncertainty in the training and testing data is dominant, followed by uncertainty in the input data, in the trained neural network, and uncertainty in the weights. We discuss the usefulness of the methodology for machine learning practice, and how, through inclusion of uncertainty in the training data, the new methodology is less sensitive to input data that falls outside of the training data set.">

        <tr id="Diffusion models have recently achieved success in solving Bayesian inverse problems with learned data priors. Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems. For example, we achieve a PSNR of 30.72dB on the FFHQ 256 dataset for phase retrieval, which is an improvement of 9.12dB compared to existing methods.">

While both information-theoretic and algorithmic limits are well understood when the noise is a Gaussian Wigner matrix, the more realistic case of structured noise still proves to be challenging. To capture the structure while maintaining mathematical tractability, a line of work has focused on rotationally invariant noise. However, existing studies either provide sub-optimal algorithms or are limited to special cases of noise ensembles. In this paper, using tools from statistical physics (replica method) and random matrix theory (generalized spherical integrals) we establish the first characterization of the information-theoretic limits for a noise matrix drawn from a general trace ensemble. Remarkably, our analysis unveils the asymptotic equivalence between the rotationally invariant model and a surrogate Gaussian one. Finally, we show how to saturate the predicted statistical limits using an efficient algorithm inspired by the theory of adaptive Thouless-Anderson-Palmer (TAP) equations.">

These methodologies have been adapted recently for solving the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe a spectrum of fluid phenomena, from the aerodynamics of vehicles to weather patterns. Within this quantum-inspired paradigm, velocity is encoded as matrix product states (MPS), effectively harnessing the analogy between interscale correlations of fluid dynamics and entanglement in quantum many-body physics. This particular tensor structure is also called quantics tensor train (QTT). By utilizing NVIDIA's cuQuantum library to perform parallel tensor computations on GPUs, our adaptation speeds up simulations by up to 12.1 times. This allows us to study the algorithm in terms of its applicability, scalability, and performance. By simulating two qualitatively different but commonly encountered 2D flow problems at high Reynolds numbers up to $1\times10^7$ using a fourth-order time stepping scheme, we find that the algorithm has a potential advantage over direct numerical simulations in the turbulent regime as the requirements for grid resolution increase drastically. In addition, we derive the scaling $\chi=\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(1/\epsilon))$ for the maximum bond dimension $\chi$ of MPS representing turbulent flow fields, with an error $\epsilon$, based on the spectral distribution of turbulent kinetic energy. Our findings motivate further exploration of related quantum algorithms and other tensor network methods.">

PCL offers high training efficiency and is well-suited for complex multi-source data systems, such as autonomous vehicles equipped with multiple sensors. However, at any time, multiple tasks need to be trained simultaneously, leading to severe training instability in PCL. This instability manifests during both forward and backward propagation, where features are entangled and gradients are conflict. This paper introduces Stable Parallel Continual Learning (SPCL), a novel approach that enhances the training stability of PCL for both forward and backward propagation. For the forward propagation, we apply Doubly-block Toeplit (DBT) Matrix based orthogonality constraints to network parameters to ensure stable and consistent propagation. For the backward propagation, we employ orthogonal decomposition for gradient management stabilizes backpropagation and mitigates gradient conflicts across tasks. By optimizing gradients by ensuring orthogonality and minimizing the condition number, SPCL effectively stabilizing the gradient descent in complex optimization tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SPCL outperforms state-of-the-art methjods and achieve better training stability.">

Despite its popularity, little is known about the convergence properties of doubly SGD, except under strong assumptions such as bounded variance. In this work, we establish the convergence of doubly SGD with independent minibatching and random reshuffling under general conditions, which encompasses dependent component gradient estimators. In particular, for dependent estimators, our analysis allows fined-grained analysis of the effect correlations. As a result, under a per-iteration computational budget of $b \times m$, where $b$ is the minibatch size and $m$ is the number of Monte Carlo samples, our analysis suggests where one should invest most of the budget in general. Furthermore, we prove that random reshuffling (RR) improves the complexity dependence on the subsampling noise.">

Here, data-driven approaches can be used to deliver a pHS for such subsystems, which can then be coupled to the other subsystems in a structure-preserving way.

This work thereby extends over the current state of the art, in which only port-Hamiltonian ordinary differential equation systems could be identified via Gaussian processes.

With this review-like paper, we thus aim to provide guidance for both statisticians and practitioners working with latent Markov models by offering a unifying view on what otherwise are often considered separate model classes, from hidden Markov models over state-space models to Markov-modulated Poisson processes. In particular, we provide a roadmap for identifying a suitable latent Markov model formulation given the data to be analysed. Furthermore, we emphasise that it is key to applied work with any of these model classes to understand how recursive techniques exploiting the models' dependence structure can be used for inference. The R package LaMa adapts this unified view and provides an easy-to-use framework for very fast (C++ based) evaluation of the likelihood of any of the models discussed in this paper, allowing users to tailor a latent Markov model to their data using a Lego-type approach.">

Some theoretical results are established, including the echo state property, the universal approximation property of RSCNs for both the offline and online learnings, and the convergence of the output weights.

A comprehensive comparison study among the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, the original ESN, and several state-of-the-art ESN methods such as the simple cycle reservoir (SCR), the polynomial ESN (PESN), the leaky-integrator ESN (LIESN) and RSCN is carried out.

Experimental methods for protein structure determination, such as X-ray crystallography or cryogenic electron microscopy, shed light on biological processes but introduce challenging inverse problems. Learning-based approaches have emerged as accurate and efficient methods to solve these inverse problems for 3D structure determination, but are specialized for a predefined type of measurement. Here, we introduce a versatile framework to turn raw biophysical measurements of varying types into 3D atomic models. Our method combines a physics-based forward model of the measurement process with a pretrained generative model providing a task-agnostic, data-driven prior. Our method outperforms posterior sampling baselines on both linear and non-linear inverse problems. In particular, it is the first diffusion-based method for refining atomic models from cryo-EM density maps.">

        <tr id="Generalization theory has been established for sparse deep neural networks under high-dimensional regime. Beyond generalization, parameter estimation is also important since it is crucial for variable selection and interpretability of deep neural networks. Current theoretical studies concerning parameter estimation mainly focus on two-layer neural networks, which is due to the fact that the convergence of parameter estimation heavily relies on the regularity of the Hessian matrix, while the Hessian matrix of deep neural networks is highly singular. To avoid the unidentifiability of deep neural networks in parameter estimation, we propose to conduct nonparametric estimation of partial derivatives with respect to inputs. We first show that model convergence of sparse deep neural networks is guaranteed in that the sample complexity only grows with the logarithm of the number of parameters or the input dimension when the $\ell_{1}$-norm of parameters is well constrained. Then by bounding the norm and the divergence of partial derivatives, we establish that the convergence rate of nonparametric estimation of partial derivatives scales as $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/4})$, a rate which is slower than the model convergence rate $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$. To the best of our knowledge, this study combines nonparametric estimation and parametric sparse deep neural networks for the first time. As nonparametric estimation of partial derivatives is of great significance for nonlinear variable selection, the current results show the promising future for the interpretability of deep neural networks.">

Cutoffs in the range of the interaction have also been used for large systems. All these methods require extrapolations. Within Markov-chain Monte Carlo, in thermal equilibrium, the Boltzmann distribution can however be sampled natively without evaluating the total interaction potential. Using as an example the Lennard-Jones interaction, we review past attempts in this direction, and then discuss in detail the class of cell-veto algorithms which make possible fast, native sampling of the Boltzmann distribution without any approximation, extrapolation, or cutoff even for the slowly decaying Coulomb interaction. The computing effort per move remains constant with increasing system size, as we show explicitly. We provide worked-out illustrations and pseudocode representations of the discussed algorithms.

Next, we use the decoupling technique to characterize the graceful degradation in RCPS guarantees when the data generating process deviates from stationarity and contractivity.

        <tr id="Markov chains on the non-negative quadrant of dimension $d$ are often used to model the stochastic dynamics of the number of $d$ entities, such as $d$ chemical species in stochastic reaction networks. The infinite state space poses technical challenges, and the boundary of the quadrant can have a dramatic effect on the long term behavior of these Markov chains. For instance, the boundary can slow down the convergence speed of an ergodic Markov chain towards its stationary distribution due to the extinction or the lack of an entity. In this paper, we quantify this slow-down for a class of stochastic reaction networks and for more general Markov chains on the non-negative quadrant. We establish general criteria for such a Markov chain to exhibit a power-law lower bound for its mixing time. The lower bound is of order $|x|^\theta$ for all initial state $x$ on a boundary face of the quadrant, where $\theta$ is characterized by the local behavior of the Markov chain near the boundary of the quadrant. A better understanding of how these lower bounds arise leads to insights into how the structure of chemical reaction networks contributes to slow-mixing.">

Utilizing proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), we extract spatial modes from high-fidelity solutions.

Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is employed to construct a mapping from random parameter inputs to the DMD-predicted coefficient field. These lead to the POD-DMD-PCE method. The innovation lies in vertically stacking projection coefficients, ensuring time-dimensional consistency in the coefficient matrix for DMD and facilitating parameter integration for PCE analysis. This method combines the model reduction of POD with the time extrapolation strengths of DMD, effectively recovering field solutions both within and beyond the training time interval. The efficiency and time extrapolation capabilities of the proposed method are validated through various nonlinear SPDEs. These include a reaction-diffusion equation with 19 parameters, a two-dimensional heat equation with two parameters, and a one-dimensional Burgers equation with three parameters.">

        <tr id="In dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) we seek to infer from time series measurements a generative model of the underlying dynamical process. This is a prime objective in any scientific discipline, where we are particularly interested in parsimonious models with a low parameter load. A common strategy here is parameter pruning, removing all parameters with small weights. However, here we find this strategy does not work for DSR, where even low magnitude parameters can contribute considerably to the system dynamics. On the other hand, it is well known that many natural systems which generate complex dynamics, like the brain or ecological networks, have a sparse topology with comparatively few links. Inspired by this, we show that geometric pruning, where in contrast to magnitude-based pruning weights with a low contribution to an attractor's geometrical structure are removed, indeed manages to reduce parameter load substantially without significantly hampering DSR quality. We further find that the networks resulting from geometric pruning have a specific type of topology, and that this topology, and not the magnitude of weights, is what is most crucial to performance. We provide an algorithm that automatically generates such topologies which can be used as priors for generative modeling of dynamical systems by RNNs, and compare it to other well studied topologies like small-world or scale-free networks.">

MPDM categorizes multi-fidelity physics simulations into inexpensive and expensive simulations, depending on computational costs. The inexpensive simulations, which can be obtained with low latency, directly inject contextual information into DDMs. Furthermore, when results from expensive simulations are available, MPDM refines the quality of generated samples via a guided diffusion process. This design separates the training of a denoising diffusion model from physics-informed conditional probability models, thus lending flexibility to practitioners. MPDM builds on Bayesian probabilistic models and is equipped with a theoretical guarantee that provides upper bounds on the Wasserstein distance between the sample and underlying true distribution. The probabilistic nature of MPDM also provides a convenient approach for uncertainty quantification in prediction. Our models excel in cases where physics simulations are imperfect and sometimes inaccessible. We use a numerical simulation in fluid dynamics and a case study in heat dynamics within laser-based metal powder deposition additive manufacturing to demonstrate how MPDM seamlessly integrates multi-idelity physics simulations and observations to obtain surrogates with superior predictive performance.">

Unfortunately, the online evaluation of these functions is restricted due to time and safety constraints in most cases. In offline model-based optimization (MBO), we aim to find a design that maximizes the target function using only a pre-existing offline dataset. While prior methods consider forward or inverse approaches to address the problem, these approaches are limited by conservatism and the difficulty of learning highly multi-modal mappings. Recently, there has been an emerging paradigm of learning to improve solutions with synthetic trajectories constructed from the offline dataset. In this paper, we introduce a novel conditional generative modeling approach to produce trajectories toward high-scoring regions. First, we construct synthetic trajectories toward high-scoring regions using the dataset while injecting locality bias for consistent improvement directions. Then, we train a conditional diffusion model to generate trajectories conditioned on their scores. Lastly, we sample multiple trajectories from the trained model with guidance to explore high-scoring regions beyond the dataset and select high-fidelity designs among generated trajectories with the proxy function. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms competitive baselines on Design-Bench and its practical variants.

        <tr id="Recent advancements in protein structure determination are revolutionizing our understanding of proteins. Still, a significant gap remains in the availability of comprehensive datasets that focus on the dynamics of proteins, which are crucial for understanding protein function, folding, and interactions. To address this critical gap, we introduce mdCATH, a dataset generated through an extensive set of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of a diverse and representative collection of protein domains. This dataset comprises all-atom systems for 5,398 domains, modeled with a state-of-the-art classical force field, and simulated in five replicates each at five temperatures from 320 K to 413 K. The mdCATH dataset records coordinates and forces every 1 ns, for over 62 ms of accumulated simulation time, effectively capturing the dynamics of the various classes of domains and providing a unique resource for proteome-wide statistical analyses of protein unfolding thermodynamics and kinetics. We outline the dataset structure and showcase its potential through four easily reproducible case studies, highlighting its capabilities in advancing protein science.">
