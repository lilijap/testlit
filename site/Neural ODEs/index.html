        <tr id="We introduce a new family of deep neural network models. Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a black-box differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.">

        <tr id="Continuous deep learning architectures have recently re-emerged as variants of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). The infinite-depth approach offered by these models theoretically bridges the gap between deep learning and dynamical systems; however, deciphering their inner working is still an open challenge and most of their applications are currently limited to the inclusion as generic black-box modules. In this work, we "open the box" and offer a system-theoretic perspective, including state augmentation strategies and robustness, with the aim of clarifying the influence of several design choices on the underlying dynamics. We also introduce novel architectures: among them, a Galerkin-inspired depth-varying parameter model and neural ODEs with data-controlled vector fields.">

        <tr id="We introduce the framework of continuous--depth graph neural networks (GNNs). Graph neural ordinary differential equations (GDEs) are formalized as the counterpart to GNNs where the input-output relationship is determined by a continuum of GNN layers, blending discrete topological structures and differential equations. The proposed framework is shown to be compatible with various static and autoregressive GNN models. Results prove general effectiveness of GDEs: in static settings they offer computational advantages by incorporating numerical methods in their forward pass; in dynamic settings, on the other hand, they are shown to improve performance by exploiting the geometry of the underlying dynamics.">

        <tr id="We present Graph Neural Diffusion (GRAND) that approaches deep learning on graphs as a continuous diffusion process and treats Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as discretisations of an underlying PDE. In our model, the layer structure and topology correspond to the discretisation choices of temporal and spatial operators. Our approach allows a principled development of a broad new class of GNNs that are able to address the common plights of graph learning models such as depth, oversmoothing, and bottlenecks. Key to the success of our models are stability with respect to perturbations in the data and this is addressed for both implicit and explicit discretisation schemes. We develop linear and nonlinear versions of GRAND, which achieve competitive results on many standard graph benchmarks.">

        <tr id="The numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) is difficult, having led to a century of research so far. Recently, there have been pushes to build neural--numerical hybrid solvers, which piggy-backs the modern trend towards fully end-to-end learned systems. Most works so far can only generalize over a subset of properties to which a generic solver would be faced, including: resolution, topology, geometry, boundary conditions, domain discretization regularity, dimensionality, etc. In this work, we build a solver, satisfying these properties, where all the components are based on neural message passing, replacing all heuristically designed components in the computation graph with backprop-optimized neural function approximators. We show that neural message passing solvers representationally contain some classical methods, such as finite differences, finite volumes, and WENO schemes. In order to encourage stability in training autoregressive models, we put forward a method that is based on the principle of zero-stability, posing stability as a domain adaptation problem. We validate our method on various fluid-like flow problems, demonstrating fast, stable, and accurate performance across different domain topologies, equation parameters, discretizations, etc., in 1D and 2D.">

        <tr id="We propose Graph-Coupled Oscillator Networks (GraphCON), a novel framework for deep learning on graphs. It is based on discretizations of a second-order system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which model a network of nonlinear controlled and damped oscillators, coupled via the adjacency structure of the underlying graph. The flexibility of our framework permits any basic GNN layer (e.g. convolutional or attentional) as the coupling function, from which a multi-layer deep neural network is built up via the dynamics of the proposed ODEs. We relate the oversmoothing problem, commonly encountered in GNNs, to the stability of steady states of the underlying ODE and show that zero-Dirichlet energy steady states are not stable for our proposed ODEs. This demonstrates that the proposed framework mitigates the oversmoothing problem. Moreover, we prove that GraphCON mitigates the exploding and vanishing gradients problem to facilitate training of deep multi-layer GNNs. Finally, we show that our approach offers competitive performance with respect to the state-of-the-art on a variety of graph-based learning tasks.">

        <tr id="Effective data-driven PDE forecasting methods often rely on fixed spatial and / or temporal discretizations. This raises limitations in real-world applications like weather prediction where flexible extrapolation at arbitrary spatiotemporal locations is required. We address this problem by introducing a new data-driven approach, DINo, that models a PDE's flow with continuous-time dynamics of spatially continuous functions. This is achieved by embedding spatial observations independently of their discretization via Implicit Neural Representations in a small latent space temporally driven by a learned ODE. This separate and flexible treatment of time and space makes DINo the first data-driven model to combine the following advantages. It extrapolates at arbitrary spatial and temporal locations; it can learn from sparse irregular grids or manifolds; at test time, it generalizes to new grids or resolutions. DINo outperforms alternative neural PDE forecasters in a variety of challenging generalization scenarios on representative PDE systems.">

        <tr id="Transformer models are increasingly used for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Several adaptations have been proposed, all of which suffer from the typical problems of Transformers, such as quadratic memory and time complexity. Furthermore, all prevalent architectures for PDE solving lack at least one of several desirable properties of an ideal surrogate model, such as (i) generalization to PDE parameters not seen during training, (ii) spatial and temporal zero-shot super-resolution, (iii) continuous temporal extrapolation, (iv) support for 1D, 2D, and 3D PDEs, and (v) efficient inference for longer temporal rollouts. To address these limitations, we propose Vectorized Conditional Neural Fields (VCNeFs), which represent the solution of time-dependent PDEs as neural fields. Contrary to prior methods, however, VCNeFs compute, for a set of multiple spatio-temporal query points, their solutions in parallel and model their dependencies through attention mechanisms. Moreover, VCNeF can condition the neural field on both the initial conditions and the parameters of the PDEs. An extensive set of experiments demonstrates that VCNeFs are competitive with and often outperform existing ML-based surrogate models.">

        <tr id="While Hyperbolic Graph Neural Network (HGNN) has recently emerged as a powerful tool dealing with hierarchical graph data, the limitations of scalability and efficiency hinder itself from generalizing to deep models. In this paper, by envisioning depth as a continuous-time embedding evolution, we decouple the HGNN and reframe the information propagation as a partial differential equation, letting node-wise attention undertake the role of diffusivity within the Hyperbolic Neural PDE (HPDE). By introducing theoretical principles \textit{e.g.,} field and flow, gradient, divergence, and diffusivity on a non-Euclidean manifold for HPDE integration, we discuss both implicit and explicit discretization schemes to formulate numerical HPDE solvers. Further, we propose the Hyperbolic Graph Diffusion Equation (HGDE) -- a flexible vector flow function that can be integrated to obtain expressive hyperbolic node embeddings. By analyzing potential energy decay of embeddings, we demonstrate that HGDE is capable of modeling both low- and high-order proximity with the benefit of local-global diffusivity functions. Experiments on node classification and link prediction and image-text classification tasks verify the superiority of the proposed method, which consistently outperforms various competitive models by a significant margin.">

        <tr id="Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) as an alternative to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) are a recent development demonstrating strong potential for data-driven modeling. This work applies KANs as the backbone of a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework, generalizing their use to the time-dependent and temporal grid-sensitive cases often seen in dynamical systems and scientific machine learning applications. The proposed KAN-ODEs retain the flexible dynamical system modeling framework of Neural ODEs while leveraging the many benefits of KANs compared to MLPs, including higher accuracy and faster neural scaling, stronger interpretability and generalizability, and lower parameter counts. First, we quantitatively demonstrated these improvements in a comprehensive study of the classical Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model. We then showcased the KAN-ODE framework's ability to learn symbolic source terms and complete solution profiles in higher-complexity and data-lean scenarios including wave propagation and shock formation, the complex Schr\"odinger equation, and the Allen-Cahn phase separation equation. The successful training of KAN-ODEs, and their improved performance compared to traditional Neural ODEs, implies significant potential in leveraging this novel network architecture in myriad scientific machine learning applications for discovering hidden physics and predicting dynamic evolution.">

        <tr id="We present a novel, and effective, approach to the long-standing problem of mesh adaptivity in finite element methods (FEM). FE solvers are powerful tools for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but their cost and accuracy are critically dependent on the choice of mesh points. To keep computational costs low, mesh relocation (r-adaptivity) seeks to optimise the position of a fixed number of mesh points to obtain the best FE solution accuracy. Classical approaches to this problem require the solution of a separate nonlinear"meshing"PDE to find the mesh point locations. This incurs significant cost at remeshing and relies on certain a-priori assumptions and guiding heuristics for optimal mesh point location. Recent machine learning approaches to r-adaptivity have mainly focused on the construction of fast surrogates for such classical methods. Our new approach combines a graph neural network (GNN) powered architecture, with training based on direct minimisation of the FE solution error with respect to the mesh point locations. The GNN employs graph neural diffusion (GRAND), closely aligning the mesh solution space to that of classical meshing methodologies, thus replacing heuristics with a learnable strategy, and providing a strong inductive bias. This allows for rapid and robust training and results in an extremely efficient and effective GNN approach to online r-adaptivity. This method outperforms classical and prior ML approaches to r-adaptive meshing on the test problems we consider, in particular achieving lower FE solution error, whilst retaining the significant speed-up over classical methods observed in prior ML work.">

        <tr id="Approximation of solutions to partial differential equations (PDE) is an important problem in computational science and engineering. Using neural networks as an ansatz for the solution has proven a challenge in terms of training time and approximation accuracy. In this contribution, we discuss how sampling the hidden weights and biases of the ansatz network from data-agnostic and data-dependent probability distributions allows us to progress on both challenges. In most examples, the random sampling schemes outperform iterative, gradient-based optimization of physics-informed neural networks regarding training time and accuracy by several orders of magnitude. For time-dependent PDE, we construct neural basis functions only in the spatial domain and then solve the associated ordinary differential equation with classical methods from scientific computing over a long time horizon. This alleviates one of the greatest challenges for neural PDE solvers because it does not require us to parameterize the solution in time. For second-order elliptic PDE in Barron spaces, we prove the existence of sampled networks with $L^2$ convergence to the solution. We demonstrate our approach on several time-dependent and static PDEs. We also illustrate how sampled networks can effectively solve inverse problems in this setting. Benefits compared to common numerical schemes include spectral convergence and mesh-free construction of basis functions.">

Such problems range from weather prediction to the analysis of disease propagation and video prediction. Modern techniques for the solution of these problems typically combine Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) architecture with a time prediction mechanism. However, oftentimes, such approaches underperform in the long-range propagation of information and lack explainability. In this work, we introduce a physically inspired architecture for the solution of such problems. Namely, we propose to augment CNNs with advection by designing a novel semi-Lagrangian push operator. We show that the proposed operator allows for the non-local transformation of information compared with standard convolutional kernels. We then complement it with Reaction and Diffusion neural components to form a network that mimics the Reaction-Advection-Diffusion equation, in high dimensions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our network on a number of spatio-temporal datasets that show their merit.">

In many cases, their tightest stability condition is coming from a linear term.

In particular, for stiff problems, ETD methods are a method of choice. We propose an extension of the class of ETD algorithms to matrix-valued dynamical equations.

Although benefiting from favourable properties of NeFs such as grid-agnosticity and space-time-continuous dynamics modelling, this approach limits the ability to impose known constraints of the PDE on the solutions -- e.g. symmetries or boundary conditions -- in favour of modelling flexibility. Instead, we propose a space-time continuous NeF-based solving framework that - by preserving geometric information in the latent space - respects known symmetries of the PDE. We show that modelling solutions as flows of pointclouds over the group of interest $G$ improves generalization and data-efficiency. We validated that our framework readily generalizes to unseen spatial and temporal locations, as well as geometric transformations of the initial conditions - where other NeF-based PDE forecasting methods fail - and improve over baselines in a number of challenging geometries.">

        <tr id="We propose Neural Walk-on-Spheres (NWoS), a novel neural PDE solver for the efficient solution of high-dimensional Poisson equations. Leveraging stochastic representations and Walk-on-Spheres methods, we develop novel losses for neural networks based on the recursive solution of Poisson equations on spheres inside the domain. The resulting method is highly parallelizable and does not require spatial gradients for the loss. We provide a comprehensive comparison against competing methods based on PINNs, the Deep Ritz method, and (backward) stochastic differential equations. In several challenging, high-dimensional numerical examples, we demonstrate the superiority of NWoS in accuracy, speed, and computational costs. Compared to commonly used PINNs, our approach can reduce memory usage and errors by orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we apply NWoS to problems in PDE-constrained optimization and molecular dynamics to show its efficiency in practical applications.">

        <tr id="Neural operators such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) have been shown to provide resolution-independent deep learning models that can learn mappings between function spaces. For example, an initial condition can be mapped to the solution of a partial differential equation (PDE) at a future time-step using a neural operator. Despite the popularity of neural operators, their use to predict solution functions over a domain given only data over the boundary (such as a spatially varying Dirichlet boundary condition) remains unexplored. In this paper, we refer to such problems as boundary-to-domain problems; they have a wide range of applications in areas such as fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, heat transfer etc. We present a novel FNO-based architecture, named Lifting Product FNO (or LP-FNO) which can map arbitrary boundary functions defined on the lower-dimensional boundary to a solution in the entire domain. Specifically, two FNOs defined on the lower-dimensional boundary are lifted into the higher dimensional domain using our proposed lifting product layer. We demonstrate the efficacy and resolution independence of the proposed LP-FNO for the 2D Poisson equation.">

        <tr id="We present a neural operator architecture to simulate Lagrangian dynamics, such as fluid flow, granular flows, and elastoplasticity. Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method (FEM), suffer from long run times and large memory consumption. On the other hand, approaches based on graph neural networks are faster but still suffer from long computation times on dense graphs, which are often required for high-fidelity simulations. Our model, GIOROM or Graph Interaction Operator for Reduced-Order Modeling, learns temporal dynamics within a reduced-order setting, capturing spatial features from a highly sparse graph representation of the input and generalizing to arbitrary spatial locations during inference. The model is geometry-aware and discretization-agnostic and can generalize to different initial conditions, velocities, and geometries after training. We show that point clouds of the order of 100,000 points can be inferred from sparse graphs with $\sim$1000 points, with negligible change in computation time. We empirically evaluate our model on elastic solids, Newtonian fluids, Non-Newtonian fluids, Drucker-Prager granular flows, and von Mises elastoplasticity. On these benchmarks, our approach results in a 25$\times$ speedup compared to other neural network-based physics simulators while delivering high-fidelity predictions of complex physical systems and showing better performance on most benchmarks.

        <tr id="This paper presents a graph autoencoder architecture capable of performing projection-based model-order reduction (PMOR) on advection-dominated flows modeled by unstructured meshes. The autoencoder is coupled with the time integration scheme from a traditional deep least-squares Petrov-Galerkin projection and provides the first deployment of a graph autoencoder into a PMOR framework. The presented graph autoencoder is constructed with a two-part process that consists of (1) generating a hierarchy of reduced graphs to emulate the compressive abilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and (2) training a message passing operation at each step in the hierarchy of reduced graphs to emulate the filtering process of a CNN. The resulting framework provides improved flexibility over traditional CNN-based autoencoders because it is extendable to unstructured meshes. To highlight the capabilities of the proposed framework, which is named geometric deep least-squares Petrov-Galerkin (GD-LSPG), we benchmark the method on a one-dimensional Burgers' equation problem with a structured mesh and demonstrate the flexibility of GD-LSPG by deploying it to a two-dimensional Euler equations model that uses an unstructured mesh. The proposed framework provides considerable improvement in accuracy for very low-dimensional latent spaces in comparison with traditional affine projections.">

Under additional regularity assumptions, we further specify this convergence rate in relation to the number of parameters, utilizing quantitative approximation results in the Barron space. Based on the previous result, we prove an approximation rate for transport equations by their neural counterparts. Our numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of SA-NODEs in capturing the dynamics of various ODE systems and transport equations. Additionally, we compare SA-NODEs with vanilla NODEs, highlighting the superior performance and reduced complexity of our approach.">

However, their implementation necessitates optimizing a high-dimensional space of parameters and hyperparameters. This fact, along with the requirement of substantial computational resources, poses a barrier to achieving high numerical accuracy. Here, inpsired by DeepONets and to address the above challenges, we present Random Projection-based Operator Networks (RandONets): shallow networks with random projections that learn linear and nonlinear operators. The implementation of RandONets involves: (a) incorporating random bases, thus enabling the use of shallow neural networks with a single hidden layer, where the only unknowns are the output weights of the network's weighted inner product; this reduces dramatically the dimensionality of the parameter space; and, based on this, (b) using established least-squares solvers (e.g., Tikhonov regularization and preconditioned QR decomposition) that offer superior numerical approximation properties compared to other optimization techniques used in deep-learning. In this work, we prove the universal approximation accuracy of RandONets for approximating nonlinear operators and demonstrate their efficiency in approximating linear nonlinear evolution operators (right-hand-sides (RHS)) with a focus on PDEs. We show, that for this particular task, RandONets outperform, both in terms of numerical approximation accuracy and computational cost, the ``vanilla"DeepOnets.">

It is often necessary to compute the solutions or a function of the solutions to a parametric PDE in multiple scenarios corresponding to different parameters of this PDE. This process often requires resolving the PDEs from scratch, which is time-consuming. To better employ existing simulations for the PDEs, we propose a framework for finding solutions to parabolic PDEs across different scenarios by meta-learning an underlying base distribution. We build upon this base distribution to propose a method for computing solutions to parametric PDEs under different parameter settings. Finally, we illustrate the application of the proposed methods through extensive experiments in generative modeling, stochastic control, and finance. The empirical results suggest that the proposed approach improves generalization to solving PDEs under new parameter regimes.">

While training is cheap, samples are generated via simulation, which is more expensive than one-step models like GANs. To close this gap, we introduce flow map matching -- an algorithm that learns the two-time flow map of an underlying ordinary differential equation. The approach leads to an efficient few-step generative model whose step count can be chosen a-posteriori to smoothly trade off accuracy for computational expense. Leveraging the stochastic interpolant framework, we introduce losses for both direct training of flow maps and distillation from pre-trained (or otherwise known) velocity fields. Theoretically, we show that our approach unifies many existing few-step generative models, including consistency models, consistency trajectory models, progressive distillation, and neural operator approaches, which can be obtained as particular cases of our formalism. With experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 32x32, we show that flow map matching leads to high-quality samples with significantly reduced sampling cost compared to diffusion or stochastic interpolant methods.">

In this article, we focus on one class of models called nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Motivated by connections to numerical integration and physics-informed neural networks, we explicitly derive the physics-informed NVAR (piNVAR) which enforces the right-hand side of the underlying differential equation regardless of NVAR construction. Because NVAR and piNVAR completely share their learned parameters, we propose an augmented procedure to jointly train the two models. Then, using both data-driven and ODE-driven metrics, we evaluate the ability of the piNVAR model to predict solutions to various ODE systems, such as the undamped spring, a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey nonlinear model, and the chaotic Lorenz system.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of deep operator networks (DeepONets) in solving both forward and inverse problems of partial differential equations (PDEs) on unknown manifolds. By unknown manifolds, we identify the manifold by a set of randomly sampled data point clouds that are assumed to lie on or close to the manifold. When the loss function incorporates the physics, resulting in the so-called physics-informed DeepONets (PI-DeepONets), we approximate the differentiation terms in the PDE by an appropriate operator approximation scheme. For the second-order elliptic PDE with a nontrivial diffusion coefficient, we approximate the differentiation term with one of these methods: the Diffusion Maps (DM), the Radial Basis Functions (RBF), and the Generalized Moving Least Squares (GMLS) methods. For the GMLS approximation, which is more flexible for problems with boundary conditions, we derive the theoretical error bound induced by the approximate differentiation. Numerically, we found that DeepONet is accurate for various types of diffusion coefficients, including linear, exponential, piecewise linear, and quadratic functions, for linear and semi-linear PDEs with/without boundaries. When the number of observations is small, PI-DeepONet trained with sufficiently large samples of PDE constraints produces more accurate approximations than DeepONet. For the inverse problem, we incorporate PI-DeepONet in a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework to estimate the diffusion coefficient from noisy solutions of the PDEs measured at a finite number of point cloud data. Numerically, we found that PI-DeepONet provides accurate approximations comparable to those obtained by a more expensive method that directly solves the PDE on the proposed diffusion coefficient in each MCMC iteration.">

We show that its approximation error of the solution can be effectively controlled by the training loss for dynamic simulations with long time horizons. The HLConcPINN method in principle allows an arbitrary number of hidden layers not smaller than two and any of the commonly-used smooth activation functions for the hidden layers beyond the first two, with theoretical guarantees. This generalizes several recent neural-network techniques, which have theoretical guarantees but are confined to two hidden layers in the network architecture and the $\tanh$ activation function. Our theoretical analyses subsequently inform the formulation of appropriate training loss functions for these PDEs, leading to physics informed neural network (PINN) type computational algorithms that differ from the standard PINN formulation.

It has been observed that DNNs are particularly well suited to weakening the effect of the curse of dimensionality, a term coined by Richard E. Bellman in the late `50s to describe challenges such as the exponential dependence of the sample complexity, i.e., the number of samples required to solve an approximation problem, on the dimension of the ambient space. However, although DNNs have been used to solve PDEs since the `90s, the literature underpinning their mathematical efficiency in terms of numerical analysis (i.e., stability, accuracy, and sample complexity), is only recently beginning to emerge. In this paper, we leverage recent advancements in function approximation using sparsity-based techniques and random sampling to develop and analyze an efficient high-dimensional PDE solver based on DL. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that it can compete with a novel stable and accurate compressive spectral collocation method. In particular, we demonstrate a new practical existence theorem, which establishes the existence of a class of trainable DNNs with suitable bounds on the network architecture and a sufficient condition on the sample complexity, with logarithmic or, at worst, linear scaling in dimension, such that the resulting networks stably and accurately approximate a diffusion-reaction PDE with high probability.">

Moreover, the use of quadrature for numerical integration endows the KNO with geometric flexibility that enables operator learning on irregular geometries. Numerical results demonstrate that on existing benchmarks the training and test accuracy of KNOs is higher than popular operator learning techniques while using at least an order of magnitude fewer trainable parameters.

        <tr id="We present ConDiff, a novel dataset for scientific machine learning. ConDiff focuses on the diffusion equation with varying coefficients, a fundamental problem in many applications of parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). The main novelty of the proposed dataset is that we consider discontinuous coefficients with high contrast. These coefficient functions are sampled from a selected set of distributions. This class of problems is not only of great academic interest, but is also the basis for describing various environmental and industrial problems. In this way, ConDiff shortens the gap with real-world problems while remaining fully synthetic and easy to use. ConDiff consists of a diverse set of diffusion equations with coefficients covering a wide range of contrast levels and heterogeneity with a measurable complexity metric for clearer comparison between different coefficient functions. We baseline ConDiff on standard deep learning models in the field of scientific machine learning. By providing a large number of problem instances, each with its own coefficient function and right-hand side, we hope to encourage the development of novel physics-based deep learning approaches, such as neural operators and physics-informed neural networks, ultimately driving progress towards more accurate and efficient solutions of complex PDE problems.">

Despite these advances, our understanding of how pretraining affects neural operators is still limited; studies generally propose tailored architectures and datasets that make it challenging to compare or examine different pretraining frameworks. To address this, we compare various pretraining methods without optimizing architecture choices to characterize pretraining dynamics on different models and datasets as well as to understand its scaling and generalization behavior. We find that pretraining is highly dependent on model and dataset choices, but in general transfer learning or physics-based pretraining strategies work best. In addition, pretraining performance can be further improved by using data augmentations. Lastly, pretraining is additionally beneficial when fine-tuning in scarce data regimes or when generalizing to downstream data similar to the pretraining distribution. Through providing insights into pretraining neural operators for physics prediction, we hope to motivate future work in developing and evaluating pretraining methods for PDEs.">

        <tr id="Modeling dynamical systems, e.g. in climate and engineering sciences, often necessitates solving partial differential equations. Neural operators are deep neural networks designed to learn nontrivial solution operators of such differential equations from data. As for all statistical models, the predictions of these models are imperfect and exhibit errors. Such errors are particularly difficult to spot in the complex nonlinear behaviour of dynamical systems. We introduce a new framework for approximate Bayesian uncertainty quantification in neural operators using function-valued Gaussian processes. Our approach can be interpreted as a probabilistic analogue of the concept of currying from functional programming and provides a practical yet theoretically sound way to apply the linearized Laplace approximation to neural operators. In a case study on Fourier neural operators, we show that, even for a discretized input, our method yields a Gaussian closure--a structured Gaussian process posterior capturing the uncertainty in the output function of the neural operator, which can be evaluated at an arbitrary set of points. The method adds minimal prediction overhead, can be applied post-hoc without retraining the neural operator, and scales to large models and datasets. We showcase the efficacy of our approach through applications to different types of partial differential equations.">

        <tr id="Deep learning with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) has emerged as a highly popular and effective approach for solving partial differential equations(PDEs). In this paper, we first investigate the extrapolation capability of the PINN method for time-dependent PDEs. Taking advantage of this extrapolation property, we can generalize the training result obtained in the time subinterval to the large interval by adding a correction term to the network parameters of the subinterval. The correction term is determined by further training with the sample points in the added subinterval. Secondly, by designing an extrapolation control function with special characteristics and combining it with the correction term, we construct a new neural network architecture whose network parameters are coupled with the time variable, which we call the extrapolation-driven network architecture. Based on this architecture, using a single neural network, we can obtain the overall PINN solution of the whole domain with the following two characteristics: (1) it completely inherits the local solution of the interval obtained from the previous training, (2) at the interval node, it strictly maintains the continuity and smoothness that the true solution has. The extrapolation-driven network architecture allows us to divide a large time domain into multiple subintervals and solve the time-dependent PDEs one by one in chronological order. This training scheme respects the causality principle and effectively overcomes the difficulties of the conventional PINN method in solving the evolution equation on a large time domain. Numerical experiments verify the performance of our proposed method.">

        <tr id="This work introduces neural Green's operators (NGOs), a novel neural operator network architecture that learns the solution operator for a parametric family of linear partial differential equations (PDEs). Our construction of NGOs is derived directly from the Green's formulation of such a solution operator. Similar to deep operator networks (DeepONets) and variationally mimetic operator networks (VarMiONs), NGOs constitutes an expansion of the solution to the PDE in terms of basis functions, that is returned from a sub-network, contracted with coefficients, that are returned from another sub-network. However, in accordance with the Green's formulation, NGOs accept weighted averages of the input functions, rather than sampled values thereof, as is the case in DeepONets and VarMiONs. Application of NGOs to canonical linear parametric PDEs shows that, while they remain competitive with DeepONets, VarMiONs and Fourier neural operators when testing on data that lie within the training distribution, they robustly generalize when testing on finer-scale data generated outside of the training distribution. Furthermore, we show that the explicit representation of the Green's function that is returned by NGOs enables the construction of effective preconditioners for numerical solvers for PDEs.">

        <tr id="Recent advances in deep learning for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) have introduced physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which integrate machine learning with physical laws. Physics-informed convolutional neural networks (PICNNs) extend PINNs by leveraging CNNs for enhanced generalization and efficiency. However, current PICNNs depend on manual design, and inappropriate designs may not effectively solve PDEs. Furthermore, due to the diversity of physical problems, the ideal network architectures and loss functions vary across different PDEs. It is impractical to find the optimal PICNN architecture and loss function for each specific physical problem through extensive manual experimentation. To surmount these challenges, this paper uses automated machine learning (AutoML) to automatically and efficiently search for the loss functions and network architectures of PICNNs. We introduce novel search spaces for loss functions and network architectures and propose a two-stage search strategy. The first stage focuses on searching for factors and residual adjustment operations that influence the loss function, while the second stage aims to find the best CNN architecture. Experimental results show that our automatic searching method significantly outperforms the manually-designed model on multiple datasets.">

Neural operators are a new type of models that can map between function spaces, allowing trained models to emulate the solution operators of PDEs.

The MgFNO combines the frequency principle of deep neural networks (DNNs) with the multigrid idea for solving linear systems. To speed up the training process of the FNO, a three-layer V-cycle multigrid architecture is used. This architecture involves training the model multiple times on a coarse grid and then transferring it to a fine grid to accelerate the training of the model. The DNN-based solver learns the solution from low to high frequency, while the multigrid method acquires the solution from high to low frequency. Note that the FNO is a resolution-invariant solution operator, therefore the corresponding calculations are greatly simplified. Finally, experiments are conducted on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and Navier-Stokes equation. The results demonstrate that the proposed MgFNO outperforms the traditional Fourier neural operator.">

To address this issue, we propose and formulate the Physical Trajectory Residual Learning (DeltaPhi), which learns to predict the physical residuals between the pending solved trajectory and a known similar auxiliary trajectory. First, we transform the direct operator mapping between input-output function fields in original training data to residual operator mapping between input function pairs and output function residuals. Next, we learn the surrogate model for the residual operator mapping based on existing neural operator networks. Additionally, we design helpful customized auxiliary inputs for efficient optimization.

By adopting the unique characteristics of KANs, notably the use of learnable univariate functions instead of fixed linear weights, we develop a powerful model for graph-based learning tasks. Unlike traditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) that rely on a fixed convolutional architecture, GKANs implement learnable spline-based functions between layers, transforming the way information is processed across the graph structure. We present two different ways to incorporate KAN layers into GKAN: architecture 1 -- where the learnable functions are applied to input features after aggregation and architecture 2 -- where the learnable functions are applied to input features before aggregation. We evaluate GKAN empirically using a semi-supervised graph learning task on a real-world dataset (Cora). We find that architecture generally performs better. We find that GKANs achieve higher accuracy in semi-supervised learning tasks on graphs compared to the traditional GCN model. For example, when considering 100 features, GCN provides an accuracy of 53.5 while a GKAN with a comparable number of parameters gives an accuracy of 61.76; with 200 features, GCN provides an accuracy of 61.24 while a GKAN with a comparable number of parameters gives an accuracy of 67.66. We also present results on the impact of various parameters such as the number of hidden nodes, grid-size, and the polynomial-degree of the spline on the performance of GKAN.">

This architecture is highly flexible, allowing the evaluation of the solution field at any location within the desired domain.

In this work, we introduce a Resolution Independent Neural Operator (RINO) that provides a framework to make DeepONet resolution-independent, enabling it to handle input functions that are arbitrarily, but sufficiently finely, discretized. To this end, we propose a dictionary learning algorithm to adaptively learn a set of appropriate continuous basis functions, parameterized as implicit neural representations (INRs), from the input data. These basis functions are then used to project arbitrary input function data as a point cloud onto an embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions) with dimensionality equal to the dictionary size, which can be directly used by DeepONet without any architectural changes. In particular, we utilize sinusoidal representation networks (SIRENs) as our trainable INR basis functions. We demonstrate the robustness and applicability of RINO in handling arbitrarily (but sufficiently richly) sampled input functions during both training and inference through several numerical examples.">

        <tr id="This paper presents a sequence of two approaches for the data-driven control-oriented modeling of networked systems, i.e., the systems that involve many interacting dynamical components. First, a novel deep learning approach named the weak Latent Dynamics Model (wLDM) is developed for learning generic nonlinear dynamics with control. Leveraging the weak form, the wLDM enables more numerically stable and computationally efficient training as well as more accurate prediction, when compared to conventional methods such as neural ordinary differential equations. Building upon the wLDM framework, we propose the weak Graph Koopman Bilinear Form (wGKBF) model, which integrates geometric deep learning and Koopman theory to learn latent space dynamics for networked systems, especially for the challenging cases having multiple timescales. The effectiveness of the wLDM framework and wGKBF model are demonstrated on three example systems of increasing complexity - a controlled double pendulum, the stiff Brusselator dynamics, and an electrified aircraft energy system. These numerical examples show that the wLDM and wGKBF achieve superior predictive accuracy and training efficiency as compared to baseline models. Parametric studies provide insights into the effects of hyperparameters in the weak form. The proposed framework shows the capability to efficiently capture control-dependent dynamics in these systems, including stiff dynamics and multi-physics interactions, offering a promising direction for learning control-oriented models of complex networked systems.">

        <tr id="A Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) is a stochastic process whose realization is a set of event-time data. MTPP is often used to understand complex dynamics of asynchronous temporal events such as money transaction, social media, healthcare, etc. Recent studies have utilized deep neural networks to capture complex temporal dependencies of events and generate embedding that aptly represent the observed events. While most previous studies focus on the inter-event dependencies and their representations, how individual events influence the overall dynamics over time has been under-explored. In this regime, we propose a Decoupled MTPP framework that disentangles characterization of a stochastic process into a set of evolving influences from different events. Our approach employs Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) to learn flexible continuous dynamics of these influences while simultaneously addressing multiple inference problems, such as density estimation and survival rate computation. We emphasize the significance of disentangling the influences by comparing our framework with state-of-the-art methods on real-life datasets, and provide analysis on the model behavior for potential applications.">

In this paper, we present a fast JAX-based implementation of grid-dependent Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) for solving PDEs.

Through comparative experiments we demonstrate that these adaptive features significantly enhance training efficiency and solution accuracy. Our results illustrate the effectiveness of PIKANs in improving performance for PDE solutions, highlighting their potential as a superior alternative in scientific and engineering applications.">

        <tr id="Partial differential equations (PDEs) are extensively utilized for modeling various physical phenomena. These equations often depend on certain parameters, necessitating either the identification of optimal parameters or solving the equation across multiple parameters to understand how a structure might react under different conditions. Performing an exhaustive search over the parameter space requires solving the PDE multiple times, which is generally impractical. To address this challenge, Reduced Order Models (ROMs) are constructed from a snapshot dataset comprising parameter-solution pairs. ROMs facilitate the rapid solving of PDEs for new parameters. Recently, Deep Learning ROMs (DL-ROMs) have been introduced as a new method to obtain ROM. Additionally, the PDE of interest may depend on the domain, which can be characterized by parameters or measurements and may evolve with the system, requiring parametrization for ROM construction. In this paper, we develop a Deep-ROM capable of extracting and efficiently utilizing domain parametrization. Unlike traditional domain parametrization methods, our approach does not require user-defined control points and can effectively handle domains with varying numbers of components. Moreover, our model can derive meaningful parametrization even when a domain mesh is unavailable, a common scenario in biomedical applications. Our work leverages Deep Neural Networks to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the PDE and the domain characteristic function.">

We address limitations of previous work on data-driven flow map learning in the sense that we focus on noisy and limited data to move toward data collection scenarios in real-world applications. Leveraging recent work on modeling PDEs in modal and nodal spaces, we present a neural network structure that is suitable for PDE modeling with noisy and limited data available only on a subset of the state variables or computational domain. In particular, spatial grid-point measurements are reduced using a learned linear transformation, after which the dynamics are learned in this reduced basis before being transformed back out to the nodal space. This approach yields a drastically reduced parameterization of the neural network compared with previous flow map models for nodal space learning. This primarily allows for smaller training data sets, but also enables reduced training times.">

In electrostatics field analysis, there are classical methods that try to solve PDE using numerical approach. Our goal is to complement the merit of classical PDE solver with modern PINN.

        <tr id="Classical model reduction techniques project the governing equations onto a linear subspace of the original state space. More recent data-driven techniques use neural networks to enable nonlinear projections. Whilst those often enable stronger compression, they may have redundant parameters and lead to suboptimal latent dimensionality. To overcome these, we propose a multistep algorithm that induces sparsity in the encoder-decoder networks for effective reduction in the number of parameters and additional compression of the latent space. This algorithm starts with sparsely initialized a network and training it using linearized Bregman iterations. These iterations have been very successful in computer vision and compressed sensing tasks, but have not yet been used for reduced-order modelling. After the training, we further compress the latent space dimensionality by using a form of proper orthogonal decomposition. Last, we use a bias propagation technique to change the induced sparsity into an effective reduction of parameters. We apply this algorithm to three representative PDE models: 1D diffusion, 1D advection, and 2D reaction-diffusion. Compared to conventional training methods like Adam, the proposed method achieves similar accuracy with 30% less parameters and a significantly smaller latent space.">

In the absence of labeled datasets, we utilize the PDE residual loss to learn the physical system, an approach known as physics-informed DeepONet. This method faces significant computational challenges, primarily due to the curse of dimensionality, as the computational cost increases exponentially with finer discretization. In this paper, we introduce the Separable DeepONet framework to address these challenges and improve scalability for high-dimensional PDEs. Our approach involves a factorization technique where sub-networks handle individual one-dimensional coordinates, thereby reducing the number of forward passes and the size of the Jacobian matrix. By using forward-mode automatic differentiation, we further optimize the computational cost related to the Jacobian matrix. As a result, our modifications lead to a linear scaling of computational cost with discretization density, making Separable DeepONet suitable for high-dimensional PDEs. We validate the effectiveness of the separable architecture through three benchmark PDE models: the viscous Burgers equation, Biot's consolidation theory, and a parametrized heat equation. In all cases, our proposed framework achieves comparable or improved accuracy while significantly reducing computational time compared to conventional DeepONet.

        <tr id="The large spatial/temporal/frequency scale of geoscience and remote-sensing datasets causes memory issues when using convolutional neural networks for (sub-) surface data segmentation. Recently developed fully reversible or fully invertible networks can mostly avoid memory limitations by recomputing the states during the backward pass through the network. This results in a low and fixed memory requirement for storing network states, as opposed to the typical linear memory growth with network depth. This work focuses on a fully invertible network based on the telegraph equation. While reversibility saves the major amount of memory used in deep networks by the data, the convolutional kernels can take up most memory if fully invertible networks contain multiple invertible pooling/coarsening layers. We address the explosion of the number of convolutional kernels by combining fully invertible networks with layers that contain the convolutional kernels in a compressed form directly. A second challenge is that invertible networks output a tensor the same size as its input. This property prevents the straightforward application of invertible networks to applications that map between different input-output dimensions, need to map to outputs with more channels than present in the input data, or desire outputs that decrease/increase the resolution compared to the input data. However, we show that by employing invertible networks in a non-standard fashion, we can still use them for these tasks. Examples in hyperspectral land-use classification, airborne geophysical surveying, and seismic imaging illustrate that we can input large data volumes in one chunk and do not need to work on small patches, use dimensionality reduction, or employ methods that classify a patch to a single central pixel.">

        <tr id="Machine learning for partial differential equations (PDEs) is a hot topic. In this paper we introduce and analyse a Deep BSDE scheme for nonlinear integro-PDEs with unbounded nonlocal operators -problems arising in e.g. stochastic control and games involving infinite activity jump-processes. The scheme is based on a stochastic forward-backward SDE representation of the solution of the PDE and (i) approximation of small jumps by a Gaussian process, (ii) simulation of the forward part, and (iii) a neural net regression for the backward part. Unlike grid-based schemes, it does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and is therefore suitable for high dimensional problems. The scheme is designed to be convergent even in the infinite activity/unbounded nonlocal operator case. A full convergence analysis is given and constitutes the main part of the paper.">

        <tr id="We present polynomial-augmented neural networks (PANNs), a novel machine learning architecture that combines deep neural networks (DNNs) with a polynomial approximant. PANNs combine the strengths of DNNs (flexibility and efficiency in higher-dimensional approximation) with those of polynomial approximation (rapid convergence rates for smooth functions). To aid in both stable training and enhanced accuracy over a variety of problems, we present (1) a family of orthogonality constraints that impose mutual orthogonality between the polynomial and the DNN within a PANN; (2) a simple basis pruning approach to combat the curse of dimensionality introduced by the polynomial component; and (3) an adaptation of a polynomial preconditioning strategy to both DNNs and polynomials. We test the resulting architecture for its polynomial reproduction properties, ability to approximate both smooth functions and functions of limited smoothness, and as a method for the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). Through these experiments, we demonstrate that PANNs offer superior approximation properties to DNNs for both regression and the numerical solution of PDEs, while also offering enhanced accuracy over both polynomial and DNN-based regression (each) when regressing functions with limited smoothness.">

However, they often rely on strong modeling assumptions and expensive numerical integration, requiring significant computational resources and domain expertise. While deep learning (DL) provides efficient alternatives for modeling complex dynamics, they require a large amount of labeled training data. Furthermore, its predictions may disobey the governing physical laws and are difficult to interpret. Physics-guided DL aims to integrate first-principled physical knowledge into data-driven methods. It has the best of both worlds and is well equipped to better solve scientific problems. Recently, this field has gained great progress and has drawn considerable interest across discipline Here, we introduce the framework of physics-guided DL with a special emphasis on learning dynamical systems.

        <tr id="A common technique for ameliorating the computational costs of running large neural models is sparsification, or the removal of neural connections during training. Sparse models are capable of maintaining the high accuracy of state of the art models, while functioning at the cost of more parsimonious models. The structures which underlie sparse architectures are, however, poorly understood and not consistent between differently trained models and sparsification schemes. In this paper, we propose a new technique for sparsification of recurrent neural nets (RNNs), called moduli regularization, in combination with magnitude pruning. Moduli regularization leverages the dynamical system induced by the recurrent structure to induce a geometric relationship between neurons in the hidden state of the RNN. By making our regularizing term explicitly geometric, we provide the first, to our knowledge, a priori description of the desired sparse architecture of our neural net. We verify the effectiveness of our scheme for navigation and natural language processing RNNs. Navigation is a structurally geometric task, for which there are known moduli spaces, and we show that regularization can be used to reach 90% sparsity while maintaining model performance only when coefficients are chosen in accordance with a suitable moduli space. Natural language processing, however, has no known moduli space in which computations are performed. Nevertheless, we show that moduli regularization induces more stable recurrent neural nets with a variety of moduli regularizers, and achieves high fidelity models at 98% sparsity.">

Leveraging Tensor Train techniques, our approach tackles the curse of dimensionality inherent in space-time methods. Here, we extend this methodology to the nonlinear time-dependent convection-diffusion equation. Our discretization scheme exhibits a low-rank structure, facilitating translation to tensor-train (TT) format. Nevertheless, controlling the TT-rank across Newton's iterations, needed to deal with the nonlinearity, poses a challenge, leading us to devise the"Step Truncation TT-Newton"method. We demonstrate the exponential convergence of our methods through various benchmark examples.

        <tr id="AI for partial differential equations (PDEs) has garnered significant attention, particularly with the emergence of Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The recent advent of Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) indicates that there is potential to revisit and enhance the previously MLP-based PINNs. Compared to MLPs, KANs offer interpretability and require fewer parameters. PDEs can be described in various forms, such as strong form, energy form, and inverse form. While mathematically equivalent, these forms are not computationally equivalent, making the exploration of different PDE formulations significant in computational physics. Thus, we propose different PDE forms based on KAN instead of MLP, termed Kolmogorov-Arnold-Informed Neural Network (KINN). We systematically compare MLP and KAN in various numerical examples of PDEs, including multi-scale, singularity, stress concentration, nonlinear hyperelasticity, heterogeneous, and complex geometry problems. Our results demonstrate that KINN significantly outperforms MLP in terms of accuracy and convergence speed for numerous PDEs in computational solid mechanics, except for the complex geometry problem. This highlights KINN's potential for more efficient and accurate PDE solutions in AI for PDEs.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a significant advancement in scientific machine learning by integrating fundamental physical laws into their architecture through loss functions. PINNs have been successfully applied to solve various forward and inverse problems in partial differential equations (PDEs). However, a notable challenge can emerge during the early training stages when solving inverse problems. Specifically, data losses remain high while PDE residual losses are minimized rapidly, thereby exacerbating the imbalance between loss terms and impeding the overall efficiency of PINNs. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel framework termed data-guided physics-informed neural networks (DG-PINNs). The DG-PINNs framework is structured into two distinct phases: a pre-training phase and a fine-tuning phase. In the pre-training phase, a loss function with only the data loss is minimized in a neural network. In the fine-tuning phase, a composite loss function, which consists of the data loss, PDE residual loss, and, if available, initial and boundary condition losses, is minimized in the same neural network. Notably, the pre-training phase ensures that the data loss is already at a low value before the fine-tuning phase commences. This approach enables the fine-tuning phase to converge to a minimal composite loss function with fewer iterations compared to existing PINNs. To validate the effectiveness, noise-robustness, and efficiency of DG-PINNs, extensive numerical investigations are conducted on inverse problems related to several classical PDEs, including the heat equation, wave equation, Euler--Bernoulli beam equation, and Navier--Stokes equation. The numerical results demonstrate that DG-PINNs can accurately solve these inverse problems and exhibit robustness against noise in training data.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we combine convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with reduced order modeling (ROM) for efficient simulations of multiscale problems. These problems are modeled by partial differential equations with high-dimensional random inputs. The proposed method involves two separate CNNs: Basis CNNs and Coefficient CNNs (Coef CNNs), which correspond to two main parts of ROM. The method is called CNN-based ROM. The former one learns input-specific basis functions from the snapshots of fine-scale solutions. An activation function, inspired by Galerkin projection, is utilized at the output layer to reconstruct fine-scale solutions from the basis functions. Numerical results show that the basis functions learned by the Basis CNNs resemble data, which help to significantly reduce the number of the basis functions. Moreover, CNN-based ROM is less sensitive to data fluctuation caused by numerical errors than traditional ROM. Since the tests of Basis CNNs still need fine-scale stiffness matrix and load vector, it can not be directly applied to nonlinear problems. The Coef CNNs can be applied to nonlinear problems and designed to determine the coefficients for linear combination of basis functions. In addition, two applications of CNN-based ROM are presented, including predicting MsFEM basis functions within oversampling regions and building accurate surrogates for inverse problems.">

        <tr id="We propose an algorithm capable of identifying and eliminating irrelevant layers of a neural network during the early stages of training. In contrast to weight or filter-level pruning, layer pruning reduces the harder to parallelize sequential computation of a neural network. We employ a structure using residual connections around nonlinear network sections that allow the flow of information through the network once a nonlinear section is pruned. Our approach is based on variational inference principles using Gaussian scale mixture priors on the neural network weights and allows for substantial cost savings during both training and inference. More specifically, the variational posterior distribution of scalar Bernoulli random variables multiplying a layer weight matrix of its nonlinear sections is learned, similarly to adaptive layer-wise dropout. To overcome challenges of concurrent learning and pruning such as premature pruning and lack of robustness with respect to weight initialization or the size of the starting network, we adopt the"flattening"hyper-prior on the prior parameters. We prove that, as a result of its usage, the solutions of the resulting optimization problem describe deterministic networks with parameters of the posterior distribution at either 0 or 1. We formulate a projected SGD algorithm and prove its convergence to such a solution using stochastic approximation results. In particular, we prove conditions that lead to a layer's weights converging to zero and derive practical pruning conditions from the theoretical results. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets and common LeNet, VGG16 and ResNet architectures. The simulations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of the-art performance for layer pruning at reduced computational cost in distinction to competing methods due to the concurrent training and pruning.">

        <tr id=". In this paper, we develop a cell-average based neural network (CANN) method for solving the Hunter-Saxton equation with its zero-viscosity and zero-dispersion limits. Motivated from the ﬁnite volume schemes, the cell-average based neural network method is constructed based on the ﬁnite volume integrals of the original PDEs. Supervised training is designed to learn the solution average difference between two neighboring time steps. The training data set is generated by the cell average based on a single initial value of the given PDE. The training process employs multiple time levels of cell averages to maintain stability and control temporal accumulation errors. After being well trained based on appropriate meshes, this method can be utilized like a regular explicit ﬁnite volume method to evolve the solution under large time steps. Furthermore, it can be applied to solve different type of initial value problems without retraining the neural network. In order to validate the capability and robustness of the CANN method, we also utilize it to deal with the corrupted learning data which is generated from the Gaussian white noise. Several numerical examples of different types of Hunter-Saxton equations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness, accuracy, capability, and robustness of the proposed method.

The methodology is based on a combination of a classical reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework and recently-introduced Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where the latter is trained on highly heterogeneous databases of varying numerical discretization sizes. The proposed techniques are shown to be particularly suitable for non-parametric geometries, ultimately enabling the treatment of a diverse range of geometries and topologies. Performance studies are presented in an application context related to the design of aircraft seats and their corresponding mechanical responses to shocks, where the main motivation is to reduce the computational burden and enable the rapid design iteration for such problems that entail non-parametric geometries. The methods proposed here are straightforwardly applicable to other scientific or engineering problems requiring a large number of finite element-based numerical simulations, with the potential to significantly enhance efficiency while maintaining reasonable accuracy.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we introduce the finite difference weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme based on the neural network for hyperbolic conservation laws. We employ the supervised learning and design two loss functions, one with the mean squared error and the other with the mean squared logarithmic error, where the WENO3-JS weights are computed as the labels. Each loss function consists of two components where the first component compares the difference between the weights from the neural network and WENO3-JS weights, while the second component matches the output weights of the neural network and the linear weights. The former of the loss function enforces the neural network to follow the WENO properties, implying that there is no need for the post-processing layer. Additionally the latter leads to better performance around discontinuities. As a neural network structure, we choose the shallow neural network (SNN) for computational efficiency with the Delta layer consisting of the normalized undivided differences. These constructed WENO3-SNN schemes show the outperformed results in one-dimensional examples and improved behavior in two-dimensional examples, compared with the simulations from WENO3-JS and WENO3-Z.">

        <tr id="The primal approach to physics-informed learning is a residual minimization. We argue that residual is, at best, an indirect measure of the error of approximate solution and propose to train with error majorant instead. Since error majorant provides a direct upper bound on error, one can reliably estimate how close PiNN is to the exact solution and stop the optimization process when the desired accuracy is reached. We call loss function associated with error majorant $\textbf{Astral}$: neur$\textbf{A}$l a po$\textbf{ST}$erio$\textbf{RI}$ function$\textbf{A}$l Loss. To compare Astral and residual loss functions, we illustrate how error majorants can be derived for various PDEs and conduct experiments with diffusion equations (including anisotropic and in the L-shaped domain), convection-diffusion equation, temporal discretization of Maxwell's equation, and magnetostatics problem. The results indicate that Astral loss is competitive to the residual loss, typically leading to faster convergence and lower error (e.g., for Maxwell's equations, we observe an order of magnitude better relative error and training time). We also report that the error estimate obtained with Astral loss is usually tight enough to be informative, e.g., for a highly anisotropic equation, on average, Astral overestimates error by a factor of $1.5$, and for convection-diffusion by a factor of $1.7$.">

Traditional methods often fail to capture the detailed features necessary for accurate modeling, presenting a significant challenge in scientific computing. In response, we introduce the Multiwavelet-based Algebraic Multigrid Neural Operator (M2NO), a novel deep learning framework that synergistically combines multiwavelet transformations and algebraic multigrid (AMG) techniques. By exploiting the inherent similarities between these two approaches, M2NO overcomes their individual limitations and enhances precision and flexibility across various PDE benchmarks. Employing Multiresolution Analysis (MRA) with high-pass and low-pass filters, the model executes hierarchical decomposition to accurately delineate both global trends and localized details within PDE solutions, supporting adaptive data representation at multiple scales. M2NO also automates node selection and adeptly manages complex boundary conditions through its multiwavelet-based operators. Extensive evaluations on a diverse array of PDE datasets with different boundary conditions confirm M2NO's superior performance. Furthermore, M2NO excels in handling high-resolution and super-resolution tasks, consistently outperforming competing models and demonstrating robust adaptability in complex computational scenarios.">

        <tr id="Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved exceptional performance across various fields by learning complex nonlinear mappings from large-scale datasets. However, they encounter challenges such as high computational costs and limited interpretability. To address these issues, hybrid approaches that integrate physics with AI are gaining interest. This paper introduces a novel physics-based AI model called the"Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Network", which treats the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NLSE) as a general-purpose trainable model for learning complex patterns including nonlinear mappings and memory effects from data. Existing physics-informed machine learning methods use neural networks to approximate the solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs). In contrast, our approach directly treats the PDE as a trainable model to obtain general nonlinear mappings that would otherwise require neural networks. As a type of physics-AI symbiosis, it offers a more interpretable and parameter-efficient alternative to traditional black-box neural networks, achieving comparable or better accuracy in some time series classification tasks while significantly reducing the number of required parameters. Notably, the trained Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Network is interpretable, with all parameters having physical meanings as properties of a virtual physical system that transforms the data to a more separable space. This interpretability allows for insight into the underlying dynamics of the data transformation process. Applications to time series forecasting have also been explored. While our current implementation utilizes the NLSE, the proposed method of using physics equations as trainable models to learn nonlinear mappings from data is not limited to the NLSE and may be extended to other master equations of physics.">

The PDE component focuses on reaction-diffusion processes, while the ODE component addresses transmission via ion channels on the cell's or organelle's membrane. However, analytically determining the underlying equations for ion channels is highly challenging due to the complexity and unknown factors inherent in biological processes. Therefore, we employ deep neural networks (DNNs) to model the open probability of ion channels, a task that can be intricate when approached with ODEs. This technique also reduces the number of unknowns required to model the open probability. When trained with valid data, the same neural network architecture can be used for different ion channels, such as sodium, potassium, and calcium. Furthermore, based on the given data, we can build more physiologically reasonable DNN models that can be customized. Subsequently, we integrated the DNN model into calcium dynamics in neurons with endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in a hybrid model that combines PDEs and DNNs. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the flexibility and advantages of the PDE-DNN model.">

Inspired by second order B-spline wavelets, we incorporate a set of simple constraints to the ReLU neurons in each layer of a deep neural network (DNN) to remedy the spectral bias. This in turn enables its use for various INR tasks. Empirically, we demonstrate that, contrary to popular belief, one can learn state-of-the-art INRs based on a DNN composed of only ReLU neurons. Next, by leveraging recent theoretical works which characterize the kinds of functions ReLU neural networks learn, we provide a way to quantify the regularity of the learned function. This offers a principled approach to selecting the hyperparameters in INR architectures. We substantiate our claims through experiments in signal representation, super resolution, and computed tomography, demonstrating the versatility and effectiveness of our method.

Further, CoNO exhibits superior performance, outperforming all other models in additional tasks such as zero-shot super-resolution and robustness to noise.

We show that VFM admits both the CatFlow objective and the original flow matching objective as special cases. We also relate VFM to score-based models, in which the dynamics are stochastic rather than deterministic, and derive a bound on the model likelihood based on a reweighted VFM objective.

In the absence of efficient exact computation schemes for Hessian diagonals, we revisit an early approximation scheme proposed by Becker and LeCun (1989, BL89), which has a cost similar to gradients and appears to have been overlooked by the community. We introduce HesScale, an improvement over BL89, which adds negligible extra computation. On small networks, we find that this improvement is of higher quality than all alternatives, even those with theoretical guarantees, such as unbiasedness, while being much cheaper to compute. We use this insight in reinforcement learning problems where small networks are used and demonstrate HesScale in second-order optimization and scaling the step-size parameter. In our experiments, HesScale optimizes faster than existing methods and improves stability through step-size scaling. These findings are promising for scaling second-order methods in larger models in the future.">

        <tr id="While the impressive performance of modern neural networks is often attributed to their capacity to efficiently extract task-relevant features from data, the mechanisms underlying this rich feature learning regime remain elusive, with much of our theoretical understanding stemming from the opposing lazy regime. In this work, we derive exact solutions to a minimal model that transitions between lazy and rich learning, precisely elucidating how unbalanced layer-specific initialization variances and learning rates determine the degree of feature learning. Our analysis reveals that they conspire to influence the learning regime through a set of conserved quantities that constrain and modify the geometry of learning trajectories in parameter and function space. We extend our analysis to more complex linear models with multiple neurons, outputs, and layers and to shallow nonlinear networks with piecewise linear activation functions. In linear networks, rapid feature learning only occurs with balanced initializations, where all layers learn at similar speeds. While in nonlinear networks, unbalanced initializations that promote faster learning in earlier layers can accelerate rich learning. Through a series of experiments, we provide evidence that this unbalanced rich regime drives feature learning in deep finite-width networks, promotes interpretability of early layers in CNNs, reduces the sample complexity of learning hierarchical data, and decreases the time to grokking in modular arithmetic. Our theory motivates further exploration of unbalanced initializations to enhance efficient feature learning.">

        <tr id="Static sparse training aims to train sparse models from scratch, achieving remarkable results in recent years. A key design choice is given by the sparse initialization, which determines the trainable sub-network through a binary mask. Existing methods mainly select such mask based on a predefined dense initialization. Such an approach may not efficiently leverage the mask's potential impact on the optimization. An alternative direction, inspired by research into dynamical isometry, is to introduce orthogonality in the sparse subnetwork, which helps in stabilizing the gradient signal. In this work, we propose Exact Orthogonal Initialization (EOI), a novel sparse orthogonal initialization scheme based on composing random Givens rotations. Contrary to other existing approaches, our method provides exact (not approximated) orthogonality and enables the creation of layers with arbitrary densities. We demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of EOI through experiments, consistently outperforming common sparse initialization techniques. Our method enables training highly sparse 1000-layer MLP and CNN networks without residual connections or normalization techniques, emphasizing the crucial role of weight initialization in static sparse training alongside sparse mask selection.

LID can be understood as the number of local factors of variation: the more factors of variation a datum has, the more complex it tends to be. Estimating this quantity has proven useful in contexts ranging from generalization in neural networks to detection of out-of-distribution data, adversarial examples, and AI-generated text. The recent successes of deep generative models present an opportunity to leverage them for LID estimation, but current methods based on generative models produce inaccurate estimates, require more than a single pre-trained model, are computationally intensive, or do not exploit the best available deep generative models, i.e. diffusion models (DMs). In this work, we show that the Fokker-Planck equation associated with a DM can provide a LID estimator which addresses all the aforementioned deficiencies. Our estimator, called FLIPD, is compatible with all popular DMs, and outperforms existing baselines on LID estimation benchmarks. We also apply FLIPD on natural images where the true LID is unknown. Compared to competing estimators, FLIPD exhibits a higher correlation with non-LID measures of complexity, better matches a qualitative assessment of complexity, and is the only estimator to remain tractable with high-resolution images at the scale of Stable Diffusion.">

Integrable nonlinear lattice equations possess a profound mathematical structure that enables them to revert to continuous integrable equations in the continuous limit, particularly retaining integrable properties such as conservation laws, Hamiltonian structure, and multiple soliton solutions. The pseudo grid-based physics-informed convolutional-recurrent network (PG-PhyCRNet) is proposed to investigate the localized wave solutions of integrable lattice equations, which significantly enhances the model's extrapolation capability to lattice points beyond the temporal domain. We conduct a comparative analysis of PG-PhyCRNet with and without pseudo grid by investigating the multi-soliton solutions and rational solitons of the Toda lattice and self-dual network equation. The results indicate that the PG-PhyCRNet excels in capturing long-term evolution and enhances the model's extrapolation capability for solitons, particularly those with steep waveforms and high wave speeds. Finally, the robustness of the PG-PhyCRNet method and its effect on the prediction of solutions in different scenarios are confirmed through repeated experiments involving pseudo grid partitioning.">

We examine properties of this class and build a structured orthogonal parametrization upon it. We then use this parametrization to modify the orthogonal fine-tuning framework, improving parameter and computational efficiency. We empirically validate our method on different domains, including adapting of text-to-image diffusion models and downstream task fine-tuning in language modeling.

Our study focuses on examining the generalization error as a component of the total error in the DBDP framework, discovering that the rate of convergence for the generalization error is influenced by the choice of sampling methods. Specifically, for a given batch size $m$, the generalization error under QMC methods exhibits a convergence rate of $O(m^{-1+\varepsilon})$, where $\varepsilon$ can be made arbitrarily small. This rate is notably more favorable than that of the traditional Monte Carlo (MC) methods, which is $O(m^{-1/2+\varepsilon})$. Our theoretical analysis shows that the generalization error under QMC methods achieves a higher order of convergence than their MC counterparts. Numerical experiments demonstrate that QMC indeed surpasses MC in delivering solutions that are both more precise and stable.">

        <tr id="GreenLearning networks (GL) directly learn Green's function in physical space, making them an interpretable model for capturing unknown solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs). For many PDEs, the corresponding Green's function exhibits asymptotic smoothness. In this paper, we propose a framework named Green Multigrid networks (GreenMGNet), an operator learning algorithm designed for a class of asymptotically smooth Green's functions. Compared with the pioneering GL, the new framework presents itself with better accuracy and efficiency, thereby achieving a significant improvement. GreenMGNet is composed of two technical novelties. First, Green's function is modeled as a piecewise function to take into account its singular behavior in some parts of the hyperplane. Such piecewise function is then approximated by a neural network with augmented output(AugNN) so that it can capture singularity accurately. Second, the asymptotic smoothness property of Green's function is used to leverage the Multi-Level Multi-Integration (MLMI) algorithm for both the training and inference stages. Several test cases of operator learning are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method. On average, GreenMGNet achieves $3.8\%$ to $39.15\%$ accuracy improvement. To match the accuracy level of GL, GreenMGNet requires only about $10\%$ of the full grid data, resulting in a $55.9\%$ and $92.5\%$ reduction in training time and GPU memory cost for one-dimensional test problems, and a $37.7\%$ and $62.5\%$ reduction for two-dimensional test problems.">

In response to this challenge, our work applies the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance as a novel regularization mechanism within hyperbolic neural networks. The GW distance quantifies how well the original data structure is maintained after embedding the data in a hyperbolic space. Specifically, we explicitly treat the layers of the hyperbolic neural networks as a transport map and calculate the GW distance accordingly. We validate that the GW distance computed based on a training set well approximates the GW distance of the underlying data distribution.

        <tr id="Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for processing relational data in applications. However, GNNs suffer from the problem of oversmoothing, the property that the features of all nodes exponentially converge to the same vector over layers, prohibiting the design of deep GNNs. In this work we study oversmoothing in graph convolutional networks (GCNs) by using their Gaussian process (GP) equivalence in the limit of infinitely many hidden features. By generalizing methods from conventional deep neural networks (DNNs), we can describe the distribution of features at the output layer of deep GCNs in terms of a GP: as expected, we find that typical parameter choices from the literature lead to oversmoothing. The theory, however, allows us to identify a new, nonoversmoothing phase: if the initial weights of the network have sufficiently large variance, GCNs do not oversmooth, and node features remain informative even at large depth. We demonstrate the validity of this prediction in finite-size GCNs by training a linear classifier on their output. Moreover, using the linearization of the GCN GP, we generalize the concept of propagation depth of information from DNNs to GCNs. This propagation depth diverges at the transition between the oversmoothing and non-oversmoothing phase. We test the predictions of our approach and find good agreement with finite-size GCNs. Initializing GCNs near the transition to the non-oversmoothing phase, we obtain networks which are both deep and expressive.">

Additionally, JKOnet* provides a closed-form optimal solution for linearly parametrized functionals. Our methodology is based on the interpretation of diffusion processes as energy-minimizing trajectories in the probability space via the so-called JKO scheme, which we study via its first-order optimality conditions, in light of few-weeks-old advancements in optimization in the probability space.">

        <tr id="Solving complex Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) accurately and efficiently is an essential and challenging problem in all scientific and engineering disciplines. Mesh movement methods provide the capability to improve the accuracy of the numerical solution without increasing the overall mesh degree of freedom count. Conventional sophisticated mesh movement methods are extremely expensive and struggle to handle scenarios with complex boundary geometries. However, existing learning-based methods require re-training from scratch given a different PDE type or boundary geometry, which limits their applicability, and also often suffer from robustness issues in the form of inverted elements. In this paper, we introduce the Universal Mesh Movement Network (UM2N), which -- once trained -- can be applied in a non-intrusive, zero-shot manner to move meshes with different size distributions and structures, for solvers applicable to different PDE types and boundary geometries. UM2N consists of a Graph Transformer (GT) encoder for extracting features and a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based decoder for moving the mesh. We evaluate our method on advection and Navier-Stokes based examples, as well as a real-world tsunami simulation case. Our method outperforms existing learning-based mesh movement methods in terms of the benchmarks described above. In comparison to the conventional sophisticated Monge-Amp\`ere PDE-solver based method, our approach not only significantly accelerates mesh movement, but also proves effective in scenarios where the conventional method fails.

        <tr id="It is a challenging topic in applied mathematics to solve high-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Standard approximation methods for nonlinear PDEs suffer under the curse of dimensionality (COD) in the sense that the number of computational operations of the approximation method grows at least exponentially in the PDE dimension and with such methods it is essentially impossible to approximately solve high-dimensional PDEs even when the fastest currently available computers are used. However, in the last years great progress has been made in this area of research through suitable deep learning (DL) based methods for PDEs in which deep neural networks (DNNs) are used to approximate solutions of PDEs. Despite the remarkable success of such DL methods in simulations, it remains a fundamental open problem of research to prove (or disprove) that such methods can overcome the COD in the approximation of PDEs. However, there are nowadays several partial error analysis results for DL methods for high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs in the literature which prove that DNNs can overcome the COD in the sense that the number of parameters of the approximating DNN grows at most polynomially in both the reciprocal of the prescribed approximation accuracy $\varepsilon>0$ and the PDE dimension $d\in\mathbb{N}$. In the main result of this article we prove that for all $T,p\in(0,\infty)$ it holds that solutions $u_d\colon[0,T]\times\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$, of semilinear heat equations with Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities can be approximated in the $L^p$-sense on space-time regions without the COD by DNNs with the rectified linear unit (ReLU), the leaky ReLU, or the softplus activation function. In previous articles similar results have been established not for space-time regions but for the solutions $u_d(T,\cdot)$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$, at the terminal time $T$.">

        <tr id="Equivariant machine learning is an approach for designing deep learning models that respect the symmetries of the problem, with the aim of reducing model complexity and improving generalization. In this paper, we focus on an extension of shift equivariance, which is the basis of convolution networks on images, to general graphs. Unlike images, graphs do not have a natural notion of domain translation. Therefore, we consider the graph functional shifts as the symmetry group: the unitary operators that commute with the graph shift operator. Notably, such symmetries operate in the signal space rather than directly in the spatial space. We remark that each linear filter layer of a standard spectral graph neural network (GNN) commutes with graph functional shifts, but the activation function breaks this symmetry. Instead, we propose nonlinear spectral filters (NLSFs) that are fully equivariant to graph functional shifts and show that they have universal approximation properties. The proposed NLSFs are based on a new form of spectral domain that is transferable between graphs. We demonstrate the superior performance of NLSFs over existing spectral GNNs in node and graph classification benchmarks.">

EGCN reproduces ice thickness and velocity changes in the Helheim Glacier, Greenland, and Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica, with 260 times and 44 times faster computation time, respectively.

It aims to estimate the state of a potentially large system, such as the atmosphere, from sparse observations, supplemented by prior physical knowledge. The size of the systems involved and the complexity of the underlying physical equations make it a challenging task from a computational point of view. Neural networks represent a promising method of emulating the physics at low cost, and therefore have the potential to considerably improve and accelerate data assimilation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning approach where the physical system is modeled as a sequence of coarse-to-fine Gaussian prior distributions parametrized by a neural network. This allows us to define an assimilation operator, which is trained in an end-to-end fashion to minimize the reconstruction error on a dataset with different observation processes.

The proposed approach extends each of the aforementioned methods and unifies them within a single framework. We can parametrically solve partial differential equations in a data-free manner and provide accurate sensitivities, meaning the derivatives of the solution space with respect to the design space. These capabilities enable gradient-based optimization without the typical sensitivity analysis costs, unlike adjoint methods that scale directly with the number of response functions. Our Finite Operator Learning (FOL) approach uses an uncomplicated feed-forward neural network model to directly map the discrete design space (i.e. parametric input space) to the discrete solution space (i.e. finite number of sensor points in the arbitrary shape domain) ensuring compliance with physical laws by designing them into loss functions. The discretized governing equations, as well as the design and solution spaces, can be derived from any well-established numerical techniques. In this work, we employ the Finite Element Method (FEM) to approximate fields and their spatial derivatives. Subsequently, we conduct Sobolev training to minimize a multi-objective loss function, which includes the discretized weak form of the energy functional, boundary conditions violations, and the stationarity of the residuals with respect to the design variables. Our study focuses on the steady-state heat equation within heterogeneous materials that exhibits significant phase contrast and possibly temperature-dependent conductivity.

NEIM is a greedy algorithm which accomplishes this reduction by approximating an affine decomposition of the nonlinear term of the ROM, where the vector terms of the expansion are given by neural networks depending on the ROM solution, and the coefficients are given by an interpolation of some"optimal"coefficients. Because NEIM is based on a greedy strategy, we are able to provide a basic error analysis to investigate its performance. NEIM has the advantages of being easy to implement in models with automatic differentiation, of being a nonlinear projection of the ROM nonlinearity, of being efficient for both nonlocal and local nonlinearities, and of relying solely on data and not the explicit form of the ROM nonlinearity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology on solution-dependent and solution-independent nonlinearities, a nonlinear elliptic problem, and a nonlinear parabolic model of liquid crystals.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promising potential for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using deep learning. 

However, PINNs face training difficulties for evolutionary PDEs, particularly for dynamical systems whose solutions exhibit multi-scale or turbulent behavior over time.

The reason is that PINNs may violate the temporal causality property since all the temporal features in the PINNs loss are trained simultaneously. 

This paper proposes to use implicit time differencing schemes to enforce temporal causality, and use transfer learning to sequentially update the PINNs in space as surrogates for PDE solutions in different time frames.

The evolving PINNs are better able to capture the varying complexities of the evolutionary equations, while only requiring minor updates between adjacent time frames.

Our method is theoretically proven to be convergent if the time step is small and each PINN in different time frames is well-trained.

In addition, we provide state-of-the-art (SOTA) numerical results for a variety of benchmarks for which existing PINNs formulations may fail or be inefficient.

We demonstrate that the proposed method improves the accuracy of PINNs approximation for evolutionary PDEs and improves efficiency by a factor of 4–40x.

        <tr id="In this paper, we investigate the full-waveform inversion (FWI) for elastic wave equation as training a neural network. The forward modeling of the elastic wave equation in the time domain by the staggered-grid difference schemes can be reformulated as a process of a recurrent neural network (RNN). As a result, the FWI problem is equivalent to neural network training, and the parameter of RNN coincides with the model parameter of inversion. Furthermore, a variety of stochastic optimizers including Adgrad, RMSprop, Adam, Nadam and Admax in neural networks can be applied in the training process. The gradient of the objective function with the model parameters is computed by the technique of automatic differentiation instead of the adjoint-state method in the traditional FWI. A new objective function of FWI is also proposed. Compared to the traditional FWI methods, the developed FWI using tools of neural networks has a relatively good robustness. Numerical computations and comparisons with Marmousi model for two and three parameters simultaneous inversion are completed. The results show that the algorithms except Adgrad can yield good inversion results. The FWI framework developed in this paper has potential applications for other complex partial equations.">

XI-DeepONet exhibits three unique features: (1) The interface geometry is incorporated into the neural network as an additional input, enabling the network to infer solutions for new interface geometries once trained; (2) The level set function associated with the interface geometry is treated as the input, on which the solution mapping is continuous and can be effectively approximated by the deep operator network; (3) The network can be trained without any input-output data pairs, thus completely avoiding the need for meshes of any kind, directly or indirectly. We conduct a comprehensive series of numerical experiments to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method.">

        <tr id="Preconditioning is at the heart of iterative solutions of large, sparse linear systems of equations in scientific disciplines. Several algebraic approaches, which access no information beyond the matrix itself, are widely studied and used, but ill-conditioned matrices remain very challenging. We take a machine learning approach and propose using graph neural networks as a general-purpose preconditioner. They show attractive performance for ill-conditioned problems, in part because they better approximate the matrix inverse from appropriately generated training data. Empirical evaluation on over 800 matrices suggests that the construction time of these graph neural preconditioners (GNPs) is more predictable than other widely used ones, such as ILU and AMG, while the execution time is faster than using a Krylov method as the preconditioner, such as in inner-outer GMRES. GNPs have a strong potential for solving large-scale, challenging algebraic problems arising from not only partial differential equations, but also economics, statistics, graph, and optimization, to name a few.">

        <tr id="The simulation of many complex phenomena in engineering and science requires solving expensive, high-dimensional systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the R\"ossler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.">

        <tr id="Areas of computational mechanics such as uncertainty quantification and optimization usually involve repeated evaluation of numerical models that represent the behavior of engineering systems. In the case of complex nonlinear systems however, these models tend to be expensive to evaluate, making surrogate models quite valuable. Artificial neural networks approximate systems very well by taking advantage of the inherent information of its given training data. In this context, this paper investigates the improvement of the training process by including sensitivity information, which are partial derivatives w.r.t. inputs, as outlined by Sobolev training. In computational mechanics, sensitivities can be applied to neural networks by expanding the training loss function with additional loss terms, thereby improving training convergence resulting in lower generalisation error. This improvement is shown in two examples of linear and non-linear material behavior. More specifically, the Sobolev designed loss function is expanded with residual weights adjusting the effect of each loss on the training step. Residual weighting is the given scaling to the different training data, which in this case are response and sensitivities. These residual weights are optimized by an adaptive scheme, whereby varying objective functions are explored, with some showing improvements in accuracy and precision of the general training convergence.">

        <tr id="The advancement of scientific machine learning (ML) techniques has led to the development of methods for approximating solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) with increased efficiency and accuracy. Automatic differentiation has played a pivotal role in this progress, enabling the creation of physics-informed neural networks (PINN) that integrate relevant physics into machine learning models. PINN have shown promise in approximating the solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, overcoming the limitations of traditional numerical discretization methods. However, challenges such as local minima and long training times persist, motivating the exploration of domain decomposition techniques to improve it. Previous domain decomposition models have introduced spatial and temporal domain decompositions but have yet to fully address issues of smoothness and regularity of global solutions. In this study, we present a novel domain decomposition approach for PINN, termed domain-discretized PINN (DD-PINN), which incorporates complementary loss functions, subdomain-specific transformer networks (TRF), and independent optimization within each subdomain. By enforcing continuity and differentiability through interface constraints and leveraging the Sobolev (H 1) norm of the mean squared error (MSE), rather than the Euclidean norm (L 2), DD-PINN enhances solution regularity and accuracy. The inclusion of TRF in each subdomain facilitates feature extraction and improves convergence rates, as demonstrated through simulations of threetest problems: steady-state flow in a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity, the time-dependent cylinder wake, and the viscous Burgers equation. Numerical comparisons highlight the effectiveness of DD-PINN in preserving global solution regularity and accurately approximating complex phenomena, marking a significant advancement over previous domain decomposition methods within the PINN framework.">

The integration of physics principles enables the method to require less data while maintaining the robustness of deep learning in modeling complex dynamical systems. However, current PINN frameworks are not sufficiently mature for real-world ODE systems, especially those with extreme multi-scale behavior such as mosquito population dynamical modelling. In this research, we propose a PINN framework with several improvements for forward and inverse problems for ODE systems with a case study application in modelling the dynamics of mosquito populations. The framework tackles the gradient imbalance and stiff problems posed by mosquito ordinary differential equations. The method offers a simple but effective way to resolve the time causality issue in PINNs by gradually expanding the training time domain until it covers entire domain of interest. As part of a robust evaluation, we conduct experiments using simulated data to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach. Preliminary results indicate that physics-informed machine learning holds significant potential for advancing the study of ecological systems.">

However, it is difficult to solve the problems numerically due to their strong nonlinearities and higher-order terms. This work is devoted to solving forward and inverse problems of the phase-field models by a novel deep learning framework named Phase-Field Weak-form Neural Networks (PFWNN), which is based on the weak forms of the phase-field equations. In this framework, the weak solutions are parameterized as deep neural networks with a periodic layer, while the test function space is constructed by functions compactly supported in small regions. The PFWNN can efficiently solve the phase-field equations characterizing the sharp transitions and identify the important parameters by employing the weak forms. It also allows local training in small regions, which significantly reduce the computational cost. Moreover, it can guarantee the residual descending along the time marching direction, enhancing the convergence of the method. Numerical examples are presented for several benchmark problems. The results validate the efficiency and accuracy of the PFWNN. This work also sheds light on solving the forward and inverse problems of general high-order time-dependent partial differential equations.">

Such results are of interest, e.g., for error analysis or consistency results for neural network training. The main result of our work is that, for a ReLU architecture with state of the art approximation error, the realizing parameters grow at most polynomially.

Especially chaotic time series that depend on a long history pose an exceptionally difficult problem. While machine learning has shown to be a promising approach for predicting such time series, it either demands long training time and much training data when using deep recurrent neural networks. Alternative, when using a reservoir computing approach it comes with high uncertainty and typically a high number of random initializations and extensive hyper-parameter tuning when using a reservoir computing approach. In this paper, we focus on the reservoir computing approach and propose a new mapping of input data into the reservoir's state space. Furthermore, we incorporate this method in two novel network architectures increasing parallelizability, depth and predictive capabilities of the neural network while reducing the dependence on randomness. For the evaluation, we approximate a set of time series from the Mackey-Glass equation, inhabiting non-chaotic as well as chaotic behavior and compare our approaches in regard to their predictive capabilities to echo state networks and gated recurrent units. For the chaotic time series, we observe an error reduction of up to $85.45\%$ and up to $87.90\%$ in contrast to echo state networks and gated recurrent units respectively.

        <tr id="Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a methodology for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using a single hidden layer feed-forward neural network. It presets the weight/bias coefficients in the hidden layer with random values, which remain fixed throughout the computation, and uses a linear least squares method for training the parameters of the output layer of the neural network. It is known to be much faster than Physics informed neural networks. However, classical ELM is still computationally expensive when a high level of representation is desired in the solution as this requires solving a large least squares system. In this paper, we propose a nonoverlapping domain decomposition method (DDM) for ELMs that not only reduces the training time of ELMs, but is also suitable for parallel computation. In numerical analysis, DDMs have been widely studied to reduce the time to obtain finite element solutions for elliptic PDEs through parallel computation. Among these approaches, nonoverlapping DDMs are attracting the most attention. Motivated by these methods, we introduce local neural networks, which are valid only at corresponding subdomains, and an auxiliary variable at the interface. We construct a system on the variable and the parameters of local neural networks. A Schur complement system on the interface can be derived by eliminating the parameters of the output layer. The auxiliary variable is then directly obtained by solving the reduced system after which the parameters for each local neural network are solved in parallel. A method for initializing the hidden layer parameters suitable for high approximation quality in large systems is also proposed. Numerical results that verify the acceleration performance of the proposed method with respect to the number of subdomains are presented.">

        <tr id="We developed a novel reservoir characterization workflow that addresses reservoir history matching by coupling a physics-informed neural operator (PINO) forward model with a mixture of experts' approach, termed cluster classify regress (CCR). The inverse modelling is achieved via an adaptive Regularized Ensemble Kalman inversion (aREKI) method, ideal for rapid inverse uncertainty quantification during history matching. We parametrize unknown permeability and porosity fields for non-Gaussian posterior measures using a variational convolution autoencoder and a denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) exotic priors. The CCR works as a supervised model with the PINO surrogate to replicate nonlinear Peaceman well equations. The CCR's flexibility allows any independent machine-learning algorithm for each stage. The PINO reservoir surrogate's loss function is derived from supervised data loss and losses from the initial conditions and residual of the governing black oil PDE. The PINO-CCR surrogate outputs pressure, water, and gas saturations, along with oil, water, and gas production rates. The methodology was compared to a standard numerical black oil simulator for a waterflooding case on the Norne field, showing similar outputs. This PINO-CCR surrogate was then used in the aREKI history matching workflow, successfully recovering the unknown permeability, porosity and fault multiplier, with simulations up to 6000 times faster than conventional methods. Training the PINO-CCR surrogate on an NVIDIA H100 with 80G memory takes about 5 hours for 100 samples of the Norne field. This workflow is suitable for ensemble-based approaches, where posterior density sampling, given an expensive likelihood evaluation, is desirable for uncertainty quantification.">

 We present a variational approach aimed at enhancing the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and more general surrogate models for learning partial differential equations (PDEs). In particular, we extend our formerly introduced notion of Sobolev cubatures to negative orders, enabling the approximation of negative order Sobolev norms. We mathematically prove the effect of negative order Sobolev cubatures in improving the condition number of discrete PDE learning problems, providing balancing scalars that mitigate numerical stiffness issues caused by loss imbalances. Additionally, we consider polynomial surrogate models (PSMs), which maintain the flexibility of PINN formulations while preserving the convexity structure of the PDE operators. The combination of negative order Sobolev cubatures and PSMs delivers well-conditioned discrete optimization problems, solvable via an exponentially fast convergent gradient descent for λ-convex losses. Our theoretical contributions are supported by numerical experiments, addressing linear and non-linear, forward and inverse PDE problems. These experiments show that the Sobolev cubature-based PSMs emerge as the superior state-of-the-art PINN technique.">

        <tr id="The parametric greedy latent space dynamics identification (gLaSDI) framework has demonstrated promising potential for accurate and efficient modeling of high-dimensional nonlinear physical systems. However, it remains challenging to handle noisy data. To enhance robustness against noise, we incorporate the weak-form estimation of nonlinear dynamics (WENDy) into gLaSDI. In the proposed weak-form gLaSDI (WgLaSDI) framework, an autoencoder and WENDy are trained simultaneously to discover intrinsic nonlinear latent-space dynamics of high-dimensional data. Compared to the standard sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) employed in gLaSDI, WENDy enables variance reduction and robust latent space discovery, therefore leading to more accurate and efficient reduced-order modeling. Furthermore, the greedy physics-informed active learning in WgLaSDI enables adaptive sampling of optimal training data on the fly for enhanced modeling accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated by modeling various nonlinear dynamical problems, including viscous and inviscid Burgers' equations, time-dependent radial advection, and the Vlasov equation for plasma physics. With data that contains 5-10% Gaussian white noise, WgLaSDI outperforms gLaSDI by orders of magnitude, achieving 1-7% relative errors. Compared with the high-fidelity models, WgLaSDI achieves 121 to 1,779x speed-up.">

The solution to CCE is ultimately obtained from the SVD of the induced asymmetric kernel matrix, providing links to KSVD. ii) Starting from the integral equations corresponding to a pair of coupled adjoint eigenfunctions, we formalize the asymmetric Nystr\"om method through a finite sample approximation to speed up training. iii) We provide the first empirical evaluations verifying the practical utility and benefits of KSVD and compare with methods resorting to symmetrization or linear SVD across multiple tasks.">

        <tr id="Operator-splitting methods are widespread in the numerical solution of differential equations, especially the initial-value problems in ordinary differential equations that arise from a method-of-lines discretization of partial differential equations. Such problems can often be solved more effectively by treating the various terms individually with specialized methods rather than simultaneously in a monolithic fashion. This paper describes \pythOS, a Python software library for the systematic solution of differential equations by operator-splitting methods. The functionality of \pythOS\ focuses on fractional-step methods, including those with real and complex coefficients, but it also implements additive Runge--Kutta methods, generalized additive Runge--Kutta methods, and multi-rate, and multi-rate infinitesimal methods. Experimentation with the solution of practical problems is facilitated through an interface to the \Firedrake\ library for the finite element spatial discretization of partial differential equations and further enhanced by the convenient implementation of exponential time-integration methods and fully implicit Runge--Kutta methods available from the \Irksome\ software library. The functionality of \pythOS\ as well as some less generally appreciated aspects of operator-splitting methods are demonstrated by means of examples.">

The problem is a repeated two-person game involving decision-making at each step informed by $n$ experts in an adversarial environment. The continuum limit of this game over a large number of steps is a degenerate elliptic equation whose solution encodes the optimal strategies for both players. We develop numerical methods for approximating the solution of this equation in relatively high dimensions ($n\leq 10$) by exploiting symmetries in the equation and the solution to drastically reduce the size of the computational domain.

We show that when the partial differential equation admits a classical solution (say $u_\star$), differentiable to order $\beta$, the mean square error of the Bayesian posterior mean is at least of order $n^{-2\beta/(2\beta + d)}$. Furthermore, we establish a convergence rate of the linear coefficients of $\theta_\star$ depending on the order of the underlying differential operator.

Learnable AKPs permit the adaptive update of incorporated knowledge to align with the features representation of data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the ACLs not only have a remarkable capacity for feature representation with a reduced number of parameters but also attain increased reliability through the analytical formulation of ACKs.

We introduce a novel weight construction for SSMs, enabling them to predict the next state of any dynamical system after observing previous states without parameter fine-tuning. This is accomplished by extending the HiPPO framework to demonstrate that continuous SSMs can approximate the derivative of any input signal. Specifically, we find an explicit weight construction for continuous SSMs and provide an asymptotic error bound on the derivative approximation. The discretization of this continuous SSM subsequently yields a discrete SSM that predicts the next state. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our parameterization empirically.

        <tr id="Herein the topics of (natural) gradient descent, data decorrelation, and approximate methods for backpropagation are brought into a dialogue. Natural gradient descent illuminates how gradient vectors, pointing at directions of steepest descent, can be improved by considering the local curvature of loss landscapes. We extend this perspective and show that to fully solve the problem illuminated by natural gradients in neural networks, one must recognise that correlations in the data at any linear transformation, including node responses at every layer of a neural network, cause a non-orthonormal relationship between the model's parameters. To solve this requires a solution to decorrelate inputs at each individual layer of a neural network. We describe a range of methods which have been proposed for decorrelation and whitening of node output, while providing a novel method specifically useful for distributed computing and computational neuroscience. Implementing decorrelation within multi-layer neural networks, we can show that not only is training via backpropagation sped up significantly but also existing approximations of backpropagation, which have failed catastrophically in the past, are made performant once more. This has the potential to provide a route forward for approximate gradient descent methods which have previously been discarded, training approaches for analogue and neuromorphic hardware, and potentially insights as to the efficacy and utility of decorrelation processes in the brain.">

While computational fluid dynamics is precise, it is computationally impractical for real-time control. Lumped thermal models divide the room into cells and explicitly model inter-cell air-mixing. However, solving the coupled differential equations is still computationally challenging. Data-driven methods like long-short term memory may handle non-linear thermal dynamics but face limitations in observability, adherence to physical constraints, and generalization. Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) impose physical constraints even while learning from data. However, PINNs still lack the scalability required for effective control in large open-plan offices, primarily due to air-mixing interactions Our approach, PhyGICS, combines graph neural networks with physics-informed learning (PI-GNN) to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we model the thermodynamic interactions as edges between nodes that represent cells. Further, the modeling approach allows explicit modeling of wall and window surface temperatures that are commonly ignored. PhyGICS, utilizing PI-GNN as a state-estimator, employs a receding-horizon approach for optimal HVAC control. We adapt PI-GNNs for building HVAC control by incorporating a time-resetting strategy to handle time-dependent ambient conditions and therefore set-points. Evaluations in a simulated environment with real-world data show PhyGICS outperforms a regular PINN model and other baseline control strategies on: 1) thermal model accuracy; 2) computation time; 3) energy consumption; and 4) user comfort.">

In particular, they have been successfully used in the context of surrogate non-parametric regression, where the kernel trick is typically exploited in the input space as well. However, when inputs are images or texts, more expressive models such as deep neural networks seem more suited than non-parametric methods. In this work, we tackle the question of how to train neural networks to solve structured output prediction tasks, while still benefiting from the versatility and relevance of kernel-induced losses. We design a novel family of deep neural architectures, whose last layer predicts in a data-dependent finite-dimensional subspace of the infinite-dimensional output feature space deriving from the kernel-induced loss. This subspace is chosen as the span of the eigenfunctions of a randomly-approximated version of the empirical kernel covariance operator. Interestingly, this approach unlocks the use of gradient descent algorithms (and consequently of any neural architecture) for structured prediction. Experiments on synthetic tasks as well as real-world supervised graph prediction problems show the relevance of our method.">

We propose an easy-to-apply heuristic to assess whether estimation of such states may be possible. As numerical examples, we consider a continuously stirred tank reactor and a liquid-liquid separator. We find that PINNs can infer unmeasured states with reasonable accuracy, and they generalize better in low-data scenarios than purely data-driven models. We thus show that PINNs are capable of modeling processes when relatively few experimental data and only partially known mechanistic descriptions are available, and conclude that they constitute a promising avenue that warrants further investigation.">

        <tr id="Backpropagation (BP), a foundational algorithm for training artificial neural networks, predominates in contemporary deep learning. Although highly successful, it is often considered biologically implausible. A significant limitation arises from the need for precise symmetry between connections in the backward and forward pathways to backpropagate gradient signals accurately, which is not observed in biological brains. Researchers have proposed several algorithms to alleviate this symmetry constraint, such as feedback alignment and direct feedback alignment. However, their divergence from backpropagation dynamics presents challenges, particularly in deeper networks and convolutional layers. Here we introduce the Product Feedback Alignment (PFA) algorithm. Our findings demonstrate that PFA closely approximates BP and achieves comparable performance in deep convolutional networks while avoiding explicit weight symmetry. Our results offer a novel solution to the longstanding weight symmetry problem, leading to more biologically plausible learning in deep convolutional networks compared to earlier methods.">

        <tr id="Branch-and-bound (BaB) is among the most effective methods for neural network (NN) verification. However, existing works on BaB have mostly focused on NNs with piecewise linear activations, especially ReLU networks. In this paper, we develop a general framework, named GenBaB, to conduct BaB for general nonlinearities in general computational graphs based on linear bound propagation. To decide which neuron to branch, we design a new branching heuristic which leverages linear bounds as shortcuts to efficiently estimate the potential improvement after branching. To decide nontrivial branching points for general nonlinear functions, we propose to optimize branching points offline, which can be efficiently leveraged during verification with a lookup table. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our GenBaB on verifying a wide range of NNs, including networks with activation functions such as Sigmoid, Tanh, Sine and GeLU, as well as networks involving multi-dimensional nonlinear operations such as multiplications in LSTMs and Vision Transformers. Our framework also allows the verification of general nonlinear computation graphs and enables verification applications beyond simple neural networks, particularly for AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF). GenBaB is part of the latest $\alpha,\!\beta$-CROWN, the winner of the 4th International Verification of Neural Networks Competition (VNN-COMP 2023).">

We propose novel approaches to improve mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal prediction of transient flow fields using graph U-Nets, enabling accurate prediction on diverse mesh configurations. Key enhancements to the graph U-Net architecture, including the Gaussian mixture model convolutional operator and noise injection approaches, provide increased flexibility in modeling node dynamics: the former reduces prediction error by 95\% compared to conventional convolutional operators, while the latter improves long-term prediction robustness, resulting in an error reduction of 86\%. We also investigate transductive and inductive-learning perspectives of graph U-Nets with proposed improvements. In the transductive setting, they effectively predict quantities for unseen nodes within the trained graph. In the inductive setting, they successfully perform in mesh scenarios with different vortex-shedding periods, showing 98\% improvement in predicting the future flow fields compared to a model trained without the inductive settings. It is found that graph U-Nets without pooling operations, i.e. without reducing and restoring the node dimensionality of the graph data, perform better in inductive settings due to their ability to learn from the detailed structure of each graph. Meanwhile, we also discover that the choice of normalization technique significantly impacts graph U-Net performance.">

In this work, we proposed a gradient smooth theoretical framework for neural networks based on the function mollification and Monte Carlo integration. The framework intrinsically axiomatized gradient smoothing and reveals the rationale of existing methods. Furthermore, we provided an approach to design new smooth methods derived from the framework.

We show that this simple procedure that require minimal coding effort has a regularizing effect and consistently lead to better generalization of KANs. We analyze the adaptation of the standard Dropout with KANs and demonstrate that Dropout applied to KANs' neurons can lead to unpredictable behaviour in the feedforward pass.

Most existed works build the model in the original geometric space, leading to high computational costs when the number of sample points is large.

In particular, we first propose Physics-Cross-Attention (PhCA) transforming representation from the geometric space to the latent space, then learn the operator in the latent space, and finally recover the real-world geometric space via the inverse PhCA map. Our model retains flexibility that can decode values in any position not limited to locations defined in training set, and therefore can naturally perform interpolation and extrapolation tasks particularly useful for inverse problems. Moreover, the proposed LNO improves in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments show that LNO reduces the GPU memory by 50%, speeds up training 1.8 times, and reaches state-of-the-art accuracy on four out of six benchmarks for forward problems and a benchmark for inverse problem.">

The trained neural network first predicts a weight vector using a given control vector, and then the corresponding field can be restored via the selected B-spline set. This method was applied to learn and predict two-dimensional steady advection–diffusion physical fields with absorption and source terms, and its accuracy and performance were tested and verified by a series of numerical experiments with different B-spline sets, boundary conditions, field gradients, and field states. The proposed method was finally compared with a generative adversarial network (GAN) and a physics-informed neural network (PINN). The results indicated that the B-spline neural network could predict the tested physical fields well; the overall error can be reduced by expanding the selected B-spline set.

While there exist various convex optimization-based estimators, they remain limited in expressivity due to their model-based approach. The success of deep learning has thus led many to use neural networks to learn to estimate SPD matrices in a data-driven fashion. For learning structured outputs, one promising strategy involves architectures designed by unrolling iterative algorithms, which potentially benefit from inductive bias properties. However, designing correct unrolled architectures for SPD learning is difficult: they either do not guarantee that their output has all the desired properties, rely on heavy computations, or are overly restrained to specific matrices which hinders their expressivity. In this paper, we propose a novel and generic learning module with guaranteed SPD outputs called SpodNet, that also enables learning a larger class of functions than existing approaches. Notably, it solves the challenging task of learning jointly SPD and sparse matrices. Our experiments demonstrate the versatility of SpodNet layers.">

For any finite ratio of hidden layer size and input dimension, the student cannot generalize perfectly, and we compute the non-zero asymptotic generalization error. Only when the student's hidden layer size is exponentially larger than the input dimension, an approach to perfect generalization is possible.

More precisely, the input space $\mathfrak X$ is allowed to be a general topological space satisfying only a mild condition ("quasi-Polish"), and the output space can be either another quasi-Polish space $\mathfrak Y$ or a topological vector space $E$. Similarly to arXiv:2109.13512v4, we show furthermore that our neural network architectures can be projected down to"finite dimensional"subspaces with any desirable accuracy, thus obtaining approximating networks that are easy to implement and allow for fast computation and fitting. The resulting neural network architecture is therefore applicable for prediction tasks based on functional data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result which deals with such a wide class of input/output spaces and simultaneously guarantees the numerical feasibility of the ensuing architectures. Finally, we prove an obstruction result which indicates that the category of quasi-Polish spaces is in a certain sense the correct category to work with if one aims at constructing approximating architectures on infinite-dimensional spaces $\mathfrak X$ which, at the same time, have sufficient expressive power to approximate continuous functions on $\mathfrak X$, are specified by a finite number of parameters only and are"stable"with respect to these parameters.">

We demonstrate that these networks can model complex conditional probability distributions, outperform backpropagation‐trained alternatives, and do not rapidly degrade with increased time horizons. Our main contributions consist of the design and evaluation of the architectures that enable the networks to solve multi‐model problems with a temporal dimension. This also includes the extension of the target propagation through time algorithm to handle stochastic neurons. The use of target propagation provides an additional computational advantage, which enables the network to handle time horizons that are substantially longer compared to networks fitted using backpropagation.">

        <tr id="To overcome these obstacles and improve computational accuracy and efficiency, this paper presents the Randomized Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RRNN), an innovative approach explicitly crafted for solving multiscale elliptic equations. The RRNN method commences by decomposing the computational domain into non-overlapping subdomains. Within each subdomain, the solution to the localized subproblem is approximated by a randomized radial basis function neural network with a Gaussian kernel. This network is distinguished by the random assignment of width and center coefficients for its activation functions, thereby rendering the training process focused solely on determining the weight coefficients of the output layer. For each subproblem, similar to the Petrov-Galerkin finite element method, a linear system will be formulated on the foundation of a weak formulation. Subsequently, a selection of collocation points is stochastically sampled at the boundaries of the subdomain, ensuring satisfying $C^0$ and $C^1$ continuity and boundary conditions to couple these localized solutions. The network is ultimately trained using the least squares method to ascertain the output layer weights.

        <tr id="We propose and compare new global solution algorithms for continuous time heterogeneous agent economies with aggregate shocks. First, we approximate the agent distribution so that equilibrium in the economy can be characterized by a high, but finite, dimensional non-linear partial differential equation. We consider different approximations: discretizing the number of agents, discretizing the agent state variables, and projecting the distribution onto a finite set of basis functions. Second, we represent the value function using a neural network and train it to solve the differential equation using deep learning tools. We refer to the solution as an Economic Model Informed Neural Network (EMINN). The main advantage of this technique is that it allows us to find global solutions to high dimensional, non-linear problems. We demonstrate our algorithm by solving important models in the macroeconomics and spatial literatures (e.g. Krusell and Smith (1998), Khan and Thomas (2007), Bilal (2023)).">

The network is trained by embedding physics-informed constraints. Different from traditional neural networks for solving partial differential equations, the proposed method uses a deep neural operator network to indirectly construct the mapping relationship between the variable functions and solution functions. This approach makes full use of the hidden information between the variable functions and independent variables. The process whereby the model captures incredibly complex and highly nonlinear relationships is simplified, thereby making network learning easier and enhancing the extraction of information about the independent variables in partial differential systems. In terms of solving partial differential equations, we verify that the multi-step physics-informed deep operator neural network markedly improves the solution accuracy compared with a traditional physics-informed deep neural operator network, especially when the problem involves complex physical phenomena with large gradient changes.">

The development of geometry informed deep learning models capable of learning a solution operator for different computational domains is a problem of general importance for a variety of engineering applications. To this end, we propose a physics-informed deep operator network (DeepONet) capable of predicting the scattered pressure field for arbitrarily shaped scatterers using a geometric parameterization approach based on non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). This approach also results in parsimonious representations of non-trivial scatterer geometries. In contrast to existing physics-based approaches that require model re-evaluation when changing the computational domains, our trained model is capable of learning solution operator that can approximate physically-consistent scattered pressure field in just a few seconds for arbitrary rigid scatterer shapes; it follows that the computational time for forward simulations can improve (i.e. be reduced) by orders of magnitude in comparison to the traditional forward solvers. In addition, this approach can evaluate the scattered pressure field without the need for labeled training data. After presenting the theoretical approach, a comprehensive numerical study is also provided to illustrate the remarkable ability of this approach to simulate the acoustic pressure fields resulting from arbitrary combinations of arbitrary scatterer geometries. These results highlight the unique generalization capability of the proposed operator learning approach.">

However, storing and transmitting these models pose significant challenges due to their massive size (e.g., 350GB for GPT-3). Recent literature has focused on compressing the original weights or reducing the number of parameters required for fine-tuning these models. These compression methods typically involve constraining the parameter space, for example, through low-rank reparametrization (e.g., LoRA) or quantization (e.g., QLoRA) during model training. In this paper, we present MCNC as a novel model compression method that constrains the parameter space to low-dimensional pre-defined and frozen nonlinear manifolds, which effectively cover this space. Given the prevalence of good solutions in over-parameterized deep neural networks, we show that by constraining the parameter space to our proposed manifold, we can identify high-quality solutions while achieving unprecedented compression rates across a wide variety of tasks. Through extensive experiments in computer vision and natural language processing tasks, we demonstrate that our method, MCNC, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of compression, accuracy, and/or model reconstruction time.">

        <tr id="Given the existence of various forward and inverse problems in combustion studies and applications that necessitate distinct methods for resolution, a framework to solve them in a unified way is critically needed. A promising approach is the integration of machine learning methods with governing equations of combustion systems, which exhibits superior generality and few-shot learning ability compared to purely data-driven methods. In this work, the FlamePINN-1D framework is proposed to solve the forward and inverse problems of 1D laminar flames based on physics-informed neural networks. Three cases with increasing complexity have been tested: Case 1 are freely-propagating premixed (FPP) flames with simplified physical models, while Case 2 and Case 3 are FPP and counterflow premixed (CFP) flames with detailed models, respectively. For forward problems, FlamePINN-1D aims to solve the flame fields and infer the unknown eigenvalues (such as laminar flame speeds) under the constraints of governing equations and boundary conditions. For inverse problems, FlamePINN-1D aims to reconstruct the continuous fields and infer the unknown parameters (such as transport and chemical kinetics parameters) from noisy sparse observations of the flame. Our results strongly validate these capabilities of FlamePINN-1D across various flames and working conditions. Compared to traditional methods, FlamePINN-1D is differentiable and mesh-free, exhibits no discretization errors, and is easier to implement for inverse problems. The inverse problem results also indicate the possibility of optimizing chemical mechanisms from measurements of laboratory 1D flames. Furthermore, some proposed strategies, such as hard constraints and thin-layer normalization, are proven to be essential for the robust learning of FlamePINN-1D.

This visualization reveals how the global minima in the loss landscape can transform into saddle points in the effective loss landscape, as well as the implicit bias of the semi-gradient method. Additionally, we demonstrate that saddle points, originating from the global minima in loss landscape, still exist in the effective loss landscape under high-dimensional parameter spaces and neural network settings.

        <tr id="Recently, a vast amount of literature has focused on the"Neural Collapse"(NC) phenomenon, which emerges when training neural network (NN) classifiers beyond the zero training error point. The core component of NC is the decrease in the within class variability of the network's deepest features, dubbed as NC1. The theoretical works that study NC are typically based on simplified unconstrained features models (UFMs) that mask any effect of the data on the extent of collapse. In this paper, we provide a kernel-based analysis that does not suffer from this limitation. First, given a kernel function, we establish expressions for the traces of the within- and between-class covariance matrices of the samples' features (and consequently an NC1 metric). Then, we turn to focus on kernels associated with shallow NNs. First, we consider the NN Gaussian Process kernel (NNGP), associated with the network at initialization, and the complement Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), associated with its training in the"lazy regime". Interestingly, we show that the NTK does not represent more collapsed features than the NNGP for prototypical data models. As NC emerges from training, we then consider an alternative to NTK: the recently proposed adaptive kernel, which generalizes NNGP to model the feature mapping learned from the training data. Contrasting our NC1 analysis for these two kernels enables gaining insights into the effect of data distribution on the extent of collapse, which are empirically aligned with the behavior observed with practical training of NNs.">

Consequently, designing efficient gradient estimators for which the computational complexity scales well with $n$ is of significant interest. This paper introduces a novel unbiased stochastic gradient estimator--the generator gradient estimator--for which the computation time remains stable in $n$. In addition to establishing the validity of our methodology for general SDEs with jumps, we also perform numerical experiments that test our estimator in linear-quadratic control problems parameterized by high-dimensional neural networks. The results show a significant improvement in efficiency compared to the widely used pathwise differentiation method: Our estimator achieves near-constant computation times, increasingly outperforms its counterpart as $n$ increases, and does so without compromising estimation variance. These empirical findings highlight the potential of our proposed methodology for optimizing SDEs in contemporary applications.">

        <tr id="This paper expands the damped block Newton (dBN) method introduced recently in [4] for 1D diffusion-reaction equations and least-squares data fitting problems. To determine the linear parameters (the weights and bias of the output layer) of the neural network (NN), the dBN method requires solving systems of linear equations involving the mass matrix. While the mass matrix for local hat basis functions is tri-diagonal and well-conditioned, the mass matrix for NNs is dense and ill-conditioned. For example, the condition number of the NN mass matrix for quasi-uniform meshes is at least ${\cal O}(n^4)$. We present a factorization of the mass matrix that enables solving the systems of linear equations in ${\cal O}(n)$ operations. To determine the non-linear parameters (the weights and bias of the hidden layer), one step of a damped Newton method is employed at each iteration. A Gauss-Newton method is used in place of Newton for the instances in which the Hessian matrices are singular. This modified dBN is referred to as dBGN. For both methods, the computational cost per iteration is ${\cal O}(n)$. Numerical results demonstrate the ability dBN and dBGN to efficiently achieve accurate results and outperform BFGS for select examples.">

        <tr id="Optimal transport (OT) has profoundly impacted machine learning by providing theoretical and computational tools to realign datasets. In this context, given two large point clouds of sizes $n$ and $m$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, entropic OT (EOT) solvers have emerged as the most reliable tool to either solve the Kantorovich problem and output a $n\times m$ coupling matrix, or to solve the Monge problem and learn a vector-valued push-forward map. While the robustness of EOT couplings/maps makes them a go-to choice in practical applications, EOT solvers remain difficult to tune because of a small but influential set of hyperparameters, notably the omnipresent entropic regularization strength $\varepsilon$. Setting $\varepsilon$ can be difficult, as it simultaneously impacts various performance metrics, such as compute speed, statistical performance, generalization, and bias. In this work, we propose a new class of EOT solvers (ProgOT), that can estimate both plans and transport maps. We take advantage of several opportunities to optimize the computation of EOT solutions by dividing mass displacement using a time discretization, borrowing inspiration from dynamic OT formulations, and conquering each of these steps using EOT with properly scheduled parameters. We provide experimental evidence demonstrating that ProgOT is a faster and more robust alternative to standard solvers when computing couplings at large scales, even outperforming neural network-based approaches. We also prove statistical consistency of our approach for estimating optimal transport maps.">

Application of ML methods to data-scarce scientific problems can be made more effective via several routes, one of them is equivariant neural networks possessing knowledge of symmetries. Here we suggest that combination of symmetry-aware invariant architectures and stacks of dilated convolutions is a very effective and easy to implement receipt allowing sizable improvements in accuracy over standard approaches. We apply it to representative physical problems from different realms: prediction of bandgaps of photonic crystals, and network approximations of magnetic ground states.

From the results obtained on the various datasets, KANs demonstrate superior or comparable accuracy and F1 scores, excelling particularly in datasets with numerous instances, suggesting robust handling of complex data.

The paper details how a recurrent neural networks (RNN) can be transformed into a contraction in a domain where its parameters are linear. It then demonstrates that a prediction problem modeled through an RNN, with a specific regularization term in the loss function, can have its first-order conditions expressed analytically. This system of equations is reduced to two matrix equations involving Sylvester equations, which can be partially solved. We establish that, if certain conditions are met, optimal parameters exist, are unique, and can be found through a straightforward algorithm to any desired precision. Also, as the number of neurons grows the conditions of convergence become easier to fulfill. Feedforward neural networks (FNNs) are also explored by including linear constraints on parameters. According to our model, incorporating loops (with fixed or variable weights) will produce loss functions that train easier, because it assures the existence of a region where an iterative method converges.">

 In this paper, we introduce the deep numerical technique DeepNM, which is designed for solving one-dimensional (1D) hyperbolic conservation laws, particularly wave equations. By creatively integrating traditional numerical schemes with deep learning techniques, the method yields improvements over conventional approaches. Specifically, we compare this approach against two established classical numerical methods: the Discontinuous Galerkin method (DG) and the Lax-Wendroff correction method (LWC). While maintaining a comparable level of accuracy, DeepNM significantly improves computational speed, surpassing conventional numerical methods in this aspect by more than tenfold, and reducing storage requirements by over 1000 times. Furthermore, DeepNM facilitates the utilization of higher-order numerical schemes and allows for an increased number of grid points, thereby enhancing precision. In contrast to the more prevalent PINN method, DeepNM optimally combines the strengths of conventional mathematical techniques with deep learning, resulting in heightened accuracy and expedited computations for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Notably, DeepNM introduces a novel research paradigm for numerical equation-solving that can be seamlessly integrated with various traditional numerical methods.">

        <tr id="The ubiquity of deep learning algorithms in various applications has amplified the need for assuring their robustness against small input perturbations such as those occurring in adversarial attacks. Existing complete verification techniques offer provable guarantees for all robustness queries but struggle to scale beyond small neural networks. To overcome this computational intractability, incomplete verification methods often rely on convex relaxation to over-approximate the nonlinearities in neural networks. Progress in tighter approximations has been achieved for piecewise linear functions. However, robustness verification of neural networks for general activation functions (e.g., Sigmoid, Tanh) remains under-explored and poses new challenges. Typically, these networks are verified using convex relaxation techniques, which involve computing linear upper and lower bounds of the nonlinear activation functions. In this work, we propose a novel parameter search method to improve the quality of these linear approximations. Specifically, we show that using a simple search method, carefully adapted to the given verification problem through state-of-the-art algorithm configuration techniques, improves the average global lower bound by 25% on average over the current state of the art on several commonly used local robustness verification benchmarks.">

Geological models of reservoirs are often associated with high uncertainly leading to many numerical simulations for history matching and production optimization. Machine learning models trained with simulation data can provide a faster alternative to traditional simulators. In this paper we present a single Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) surrogate that outperforms traditional reservoir simulators by the ability to predict pressures and saturations on varying permeability fields, well locations, well controls, and number of wells. The maximum-mean relative error of 95\% of pressure and saturation predictions is less than 5\%. This is achieved by employing a simple yet very effective data augmentation technique that reduces the dataset size by 75\% and reduces overfitting. Also, constructing the input tensor in a binary fashion enables predictions on unseen well locations, well controls, and number of wells. Such model can accelerate history matching and reservoir characterization procedures by several orders of magnitude. The ability to predict on new well locations, well controls, and number of wells enables highly efficient reservoir management and optimization.">

In this paper, we propose a semi-adaptive synergetic two-way pseudoinverse learning system, wherein each subsystem encompasses forward learning, backward learning, and feature concatenation modules. The whole system is trained using a non-gradient descent learning algorithm. It simplifies the hyperparameter tuning while improving the training efficiency.

Analytic models that adhere to all three are hard to develop and cumbersome to work with, often resulting in sacrificing one of these elements for the sake of efficiency. In this work, two deep-learning methods are proposed that provably satisfy the first and second conditions on a large-enough region of thermodynamic variable space. The first is based on learning the generating function (thermodynamic potential) while the second is based on structure-preserving, symplectic neural networks, respectively allowing modifications near or on phase transition regions. They can be used either"from scratch"to learn a full Equation of State, or in conjunction with a pre-existing consistent model, functioning as a modification that better adheres to experimental data.

Our approach is conceptually based on a loss that upper bounds the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and evades the requirement of exact sample likelihoods.

However, solving inverse problems involving fractional derivatives presents notable challenges, including issues related to stability and uniqueness. While Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as effective tools for solving inverse problems, most existing PINN frameworks primarily focus on integer-ordered derivatives. In this study, we extend the application of PINNs to address inverse problems involving time-fractional derivatives, specifically targeting two problems: 1) anomalous diffusion and 2) fractional viscoelastic constitutive equation. Leveraging both numerically generated datasets and experimental data, we calibrate the concentration-dependent generalized diffusion coefficient and parameters for the fractional Maxwell model. We devise a tailored residual loss function that scales with the standard deviation of observed data. We rigorously test our framework's efficacy in handling anomalous diffusion. Even after introducing 25% Gaussian noise to the concentration dataset, our framework demonstrates remarkable robustness. Notably, the relative error in predicting the generalized diffusion coefficient and the order of the fractional derivative is less than 10% for all cases, underscoring the resilience and accuracy of our approach. In another test case, we predict relaxation moduli for three pig tissue samples, consistently achieving relative errors below 10%. Furthermore, our framework exhibits promise in modeling anomalous diffusion and non-linear fractional viscoelasticity.">

Several variations of deep neural network architectures have been designed to tackle this task. However, due to their huge computational costs and their high memory consumption, these models are not meant to be deployed on resource-constrained systems. To address this limitation, we introduce an end-to-end biologically inspired semantic segmentation approach by combining Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs, a low-power alternative to classical neural networks) with event cameras whose output data can directly feed these neural network inputs. We have designed EvSegSNN, a biologically plausible encoder-decoder U-shaped architecture relying on Parametric Leaky Integrate and Fire neurons in an objective to trade-off resource usage against performance. The experiments conducted on DDD17 demonstrate that EvSegSNN outperforms the closest state-of-the-art model in terms of MIoU while reducing the number of parameters by a factor of $1.6$ and sparing a batch normalization stage.">

The first one is that they require long time to design. The other is that they heavily rely on labelled data, which can sometimes be costly and hard to obtain. In order to address the first problem, neuroevolution has been proved to be a plausible option to automate the design of DNNs. As for the second problem, self-supervised learning has been used to leverage unlabelled data to learn representations. Our goal is to study how neuroevolution can help self-supervised learning to bridge the gap to supervised learning in terms of performance. In this work, we propose a framework that is able to evolve deep neural networks using self-supervised learning. Our results on the CIFAR-10 dataset show that it is possible to evolve adequate neural networks while reducing the reliance on labelled data. Moreover, an analysis to the structure of the evolved networks suggests that the amount of labelled data fed to them has less effect on the structure of networks that learned via self-supervised learning, when compared to individuals that relied on supervised learning.">

        <tr id="Different from human nature, it is still common practice today for vision tasks to train deep learning models only initially and on fixed datasets. A variety of approaches have recently addressed handling continual data streams. However, extending these methods to manage out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios has not effectively been investigated. On the other hand, it has recently been shown that non-continual neural mesh models exhibit strong performance in generalizing to such OOD scenarios. To leverage this decisive property in a continual learning setting, we propose incremental neural mesh models that can be extended with new meshes over time. In addition, we present a latent space initialization strategy that enables us to allocate feature space for future unseen classes in advance and a positional regularization term that forces the features of the different classes to consistently stay in respective latent space regions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on the Pascal3D and ObjectNet3D datasets and show that our approach outperforms the baselines for classification by $2-6\%$ in the in-domain and by $6-50\%$ in the OOD setting. Our work also presents the first incremental learning approach for pose estimation. Our code and model can be found at https://github.com/Fischer-Tom/iNeMo.">

Given this flexibility in the number of steps, we additionally propose a new termination algorithm to provide the model the power to choose how many steps to make automatically.

Leveraging recent analytical progress in the proportional regime of deep learning theory (i.e. the limit where the size of the training set $P$ and the size of the hidden layers $N$ are taken to infinity keeping their ratio $\alpha = P/N$ finite), in this work we develop a novel single-instance Franz-Parisi formalism that yields an effective theory for TL in fully-connected neural networks. Unlike the (lazy-training) infinite-width limit, where TL is ineffective, we demonstrate that in the proportional limit TL occurs due to a renormalized source-target kernel that quantifies their relatedness and determines whether TL is beneficial for generalization.">

        <tr id="In this work, we describe a new approach that uses variational encoder-decoder (VED) networks for efficient uncertainty quantification for goal-oriented inverse problems. Contrary to standard inverse problems, these approaches are goal-oriented in that the goal is to estimate some quantities of interest (QoI) that are functions of the solution of an inverse problem, rather than the solution itself. Moreover, we are interested in computing uncertainty metrics associated with the QoI, thus utilizing a Bayesian approach for inverse problems that incorporates the prediction operator and techniques for exploring the posterior. This may be particularly challenging, especially for nonlinear, possibly unknown, operators and nonstandard prior assumptions. We harness recent advances in machine learning, i.e. VED networks, to describe a data-driven approach to large-scale inverse problems. This enables a real-time uncertainty quantification for the QoI. One of the advantages of our approach is that we avoid the need to solve challenging inversion problems by training a network to approximate the mapping from observations to QoI. Another main benefit is that we enable uncertainty quantification for the QoI by leveraging probability distributions in the latent and target spaces. This allows us to efficiently generate QoI samples and circumvent complicated or even unknown forward models and prediction operators. Numerical results from medical tomography reconstruction and nonlinear hydraulic tomography demonstrate the potential and broad applicability of the approach.">

Due to the properties of flexible materials, the movements of soft objects are often highly nonlinear and, thus, complex to predict. Data-driven approaches seem promising for modeling those complex dynamics but often neglect basic physical principles, which consequently makes them untrustworthy and limits generalization. To address this problem, we propose a physics-constrained learning method that combines powerful learning tools and reliable physical models. Our method leverages the data collected from observations by sending them into a Gaussian process that is physically constrained by a distributed Port-Hamiltonian model. Based on the Bayesian nature of the Gaussian process, we not only learn the dynamics of the system, but also enable uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, the proposed approach preserves the compositional nature of Port-Hamiltonian systems.">

        <tr id="Most existing theoretical investigations of the accuracy of diffusion models, albeit significant, assume the score function has been approximated to a certain accuracy, and then use this a priori bound to control the error of generation. This article instead provides a first quantitative understanding of the whole generation process, i.e., both training and sampling. More precisely, it conducts a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of denoising score matching under gradient descent. In addition, a refined sampling error analysis for variance exploding models is also provided. The combination of these two results yields a full error analysis, which elucidates (again, but this time theoretically) how to design the training and sampling processes for effective generation. For instance, our theory implies a preference toward noise distribution and loss weighting in training that qualitatively agree with the ones used in [Karras et al. 2022]. It also provides perspectives on the choices of time and variance schedules in sampling: when the score is well trained, the design in [Song et al. 2020] is more preferable, but when it is less trained, the design in [Karras et al. 2022] becomes more preferable.">

        <tr id="Neural networks that can produce accurate, input-conditional uncertainty representations are critical for real-world applications. Recent progress on heteroscedastic continuous regression has shown great promise for calibrated uncertainty quantification on complex tasks, like image regression. However, when these methods are applied to discrete regression tasks, such as crowd counting, ratings prediction, or inventory estimation, they tend to produce predictive distributions with numerous pathologies. We propose to address these issues by training a neural network to output the parameters of a Double Poisson distribution, which we call the Deep Double Poisson Network (DDPN). In contrast to existing methods that are trained to minimize Gaussian negative log likelihood (NLL), DDPNs produce a proper probability mass function over discrete output. Additionally, DDPNs naturally model under-, over-, and equi-dispersion, unlike networks trained with the more rigid Poisson and Negative Binomial parameterizations. We show DDPNs 1) vastly outperform existing discrete models; 2) meet or exceed the accuracy and flexibility of networks trained with Gaussian NLL; 3) produce proper predictive distributions over discrete counts; and 4) exhibit superior out-of-distribution detection. DDPNs can easily be applied to a variety of count regression datasets including tabular, image, point cloud, and text data.">

Where conventional networks perform a parameterized weighted sum of the inputs at each node and then feed the result into a statically defined nonlinearity, KANs perform non-linear computations represented by B-SPLINES on the edges leading to each node and then just sum up the inputs at the node. Instead of learning weights, the system learns the spline parameters. In the original work, such networks have been shown to be able to more efficiently and exactly learn sophisticated real valued functions e.g. in regression or PDE solution. We hypothesize that such an ability is also advantageous for computing low-level features for IMU-based HAR. To this end, we have implemented KAN as the feature extraction architecture for IMU-based human activity recognition tasks, including four architecture variations. We present an initial performance investigation of the KAN feature extractor on four public HAR datasets.

        <tr id="Predicting the dynamics of turbulent fluid flows has long been a central goal of science and engineering. Yet, even with modern computing technology, accurate simulation of all but the simplest turbulent flow-fields remains impossible: the fields are too chaotic and multi-scaled to directly store them in memory and perform time-evolution. An alternative is to treat turbulence $\textit{probabilistically}$, viewing flow properties as random variables distributed according to joint probability density functions (PDFs). Turbulence PDFs are neither chaotic nor multi-scale, but are still challenging to simulate due to their high dimensionality. Here we show how to overcome the dimensionality problem by parameterising turbulence PDFs into an extremely compressed format known as a"tensor network"(TN). The TN paradigm enables simulations on single CPU cores that would otherwise be impractical even with supercomputers: for a $5+1$ dimensional PDF of a chemically reactive turbulent flow, we achieve reductions in memory and computational costs by factors of $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$, respectively, compared to standard finite difference algorithms. A future path is opened towards something heretofore regarded as infeasible: directly simulating high-dimensional PDFs of both turbulent flows and other chaotic systems that are useful to describe probabilistically.">

We propose a two-step method for learning the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation given snapshots of the process. In the first step, we learn the drift by applying the occupation kernel algorithm to the expected value of the process. In the second step, we learn the diffusion given the drift using a semi-definite program. Specifically, we learn the diffusion squared as a non-negative function in a RKHS associated with the square of a kernel. We present examples and simulations.">

We propose a spatially dependent physics-informed neural network (SD-PINN), which enables recovering coefficients in spatially dependent PDEs using one neural network, eliminating the requirement for domain-specific physical expertise. The network is trained by minimizing a combination of loss functions involving data-fitting and physical constraints, in which the requirement for satisfying the assumed governing PDE is encoded. For the recovery of spatially two-dimensional (2D) PDEs, we store the PDE coefficients at all locations in the 2D region of interest into a matrix and incorporate a low-rank assumption for this matrix to recover the coefficients at locations without measurements. We apply the SD-PINN to recovering spatially dependent coefficients of the wave equation to reveal the spatial distribution of acoustic properties in the inhomogeneous medium.">

        <tr id="Quadratic programming (QP) is the most widely applied category of problems in nonlinear programming. Many applications require real-time/fast solutions, though not necessarily with high precision. Existing methods either involve matrix decomposition or use the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. For relatively large instances, these methods cannot achieve the real-time requirement unless there is an effective precondition. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) opened new possibilities for QP. Some promising empirical studies of applying GNNs for QP tasks show that GNNs can capture key characteristics of an optimization instance and provide adaptive guidance accordingly to crucial configurations during the solving process, or directly provide an approximate solution. Despite notable empirical observations, theoretical foundations are still lacking. In this work, we investigate the expressive or representative power of GNNs, a crucial aspect of neural network theory, specifically in the context of QP tasks, with both continuous and mixed-integer settings. We prove the existence of message-passing GNNs that can reliably represent key properties of quadratic programs, including feasibility, optimal objective value, and optimal solution. Our theory is validated by numerical results.">

Despite demonstrating potential across diverse applications, PINNs have encountered challenges in accurately predicting solutions for time-dependent problems. In response, this study presents a novel methodology aimed at enhancing the predictive capability of PINNs for time-dependent scenarios. Our approach involves dividing the temporal domain into multiple subdomains and employing an adaptive weighting strategy at the initial condition and at the interfaces between these subdomains. By employing such interfacial conditioning in physics informed neural networks (IcPINN), we have solved several unsteady PDEs (e.g., Allen–Cahn equation, advection equation, Korteweg–De Vries equation, Cahn–Hilliard equation, and Navier–Stokes equations) and conducted a comparative analysis with numerical results.

The DEQH model inherently captures the self-consistency nature of Hamiltonian, a critical aspect often overlooked by traditional machine learning approaches for Hamiltonian prediction. By employing DEQ within our model architecture, we circumvent the need for DFT calculations during the training phase to introduce the Hamiltonian's self-consistency, thus addressing computational bottlenecks associated with large or complex systems. We propose a versatile framework that combines DEQ with off-the-shelf machine learning models for predicting Hamiltonians. When benchmarked on the MD17 and QH9 datasets, DEQHNet, an instantiation of the DEQH framework, has demonstrated a significant improvement in prediction accuracy. Beyond a predictor, the DEQH model is a Hamiltonian solver, in the sense that it uses the fixed-point solving capability of the deep equilibrium model to iteratively solve for the Hamiltonian. Ablation studies of DEQHNet further elucidate the network's effectiveness, offering insights into the potential of DEQ-integrated networks for Hamiltonian learning.">

We develop a neural network mechanism that provides a fast and accurate predictor of these distributions for moderate horizon lengths and practical settings. It is based on using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture based on the first several moments of the time-dependant inter-arrival and the stationary service time distributions; we call it the Moment-Based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) method (MBRNN ). Our empirical study suggests MBRNN requires only the first four inter-arrival and service time moments. We use simulation to generate a substantial training dataset and present a thorough performance evaluation to examine the accuracy of our method using two different test sets. We show that even under the configuration with the worst performance errors, the mean number of customers over the entire timeline has an error of less than 3%. While simulation modeling can achieve high accuracy, the advantage of the MBRNN over simulation is runtime, while the MBRNN analyzes hundreds of systems within a fraction of a second. This paper focuses on a G(t)/GI/1; however, the MBRNN approach demonstrated here can be extended to other queueing systems, as the training data labeling is based on simulations (which can be applied to more complex systems) and the training is based on deep learning, which can capture very complex time sequence tasks. In summary, the MBRNN can potentially revolutionize our ability to perform transient analyses of queueing systems.">

However, for complex problems, training these networks can still be challenging, often resulting in unsatisfactory accuracy and efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate that the failure of plain physics-informed neural networks arises from the significant discrepancy in the convergence speed of residuals at different training points, where the slowest convergence speed dominates the overall solution convergence. Based on these observations, we propose a point-wise adaptive weighting method that balances the residual decay rate across different training points. The performance of our proposed adaptive weighting method is compared with current state-of-the-art adaptive weighting methods on benchmark problems for both physics-informed neural networks and physics-informed deep operator networks. Through extensive numerical results we demonstrate that our proposed approach of balanced residual decay rates offers several advantages, including bounded weights, high prediction accuracy, fast convergence speed, low training uncertainty, low computational cost and ease of hyperparameter tuning.">

        <tr id="Generalization theory has been established for sparse deep neural networks under high-dimensional regime. Beyond generalization, parameter estimation is also important since it is crucial for variable selection and interpretability of deep neural networks. Current theoretical studies concerning parameter estimation mainly focus on two-layer neural networks, which is due to the fact that the convergence of parameter estimation heavily relies on the regularity of the Hessian matrix, while the Hessian matrix of deep neural networks is highly singular. To avoid the unidentifiability of deep neural networks in parameter estimation, we propose to conduct nonparametric estimation of partial derivatives with respect to inputs. We first show that model convergence of sparse deep neural networks is guaranteed in that the sample complexity only grows with the logarithm of the number of parameters or the input dimension when the $\ell_{1}$-norm of parameters is well constrained. Then by bounding the norm and the divergence of partial derivatives, we establish that the convergence rate of nonparametric estimation of partial derivatives scales as $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/4})$, a rate which is slower than the model convergence rate $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$. To the best of our knowledge, this study combines nonparametric estimation and parametric sparse deep neural networks for the first time. As nonparametric estimation of partial derivatives is of great significance for nonlinear variable selection, the current results show the promising future for the interpretability of deep neural networks.">

This approach improves precision through the warm start of a hierarchical unconstrained nonlinear optimization algorithm, combining the robustness of traditional optimization with the speed and adaptability of modern deep learning methods. Our results on an existing benchmark demonstrate that LInK outperforms existing methods with 28 times less error compared to a state-of-the-art approach while taking 20 times less time on an existing benchmark. Moreover, we introduce a significantly more challenging benchmark, named LINK-ABC, which involves synthesizing linkages that trace the trajectories of English capital alphabets - an inverse design benchmark task that existing methods struggle with due to large non-linearities and tiny feasible space.

We dub this process surrogate training embedded in physics (STEP) and illustrate that it generalizes well and is robust against overfitting and significant noise in the data. We demonstrate how STEP can be applied to perform dynamic kernel deconvolution to analyse resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectra and show that surprisingly simple estimator architectures suffice to extract the relevant physical information.">

Low-rank recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit such interpretability by having tractable dynamics. However, it is unclear how to best fit low-rank RNNs to data consisting of noisy observations of an underlying stochastic system. Here, we propose to fit stochastic low-rank RNNs with variational sequential Monte Carlo methods. We validate our method on several datasets consisting of both continuous and spiking neural data, where we obtain lower dimensional latent dynamics than current state of the art methods. Additionally, for low-rank models with piecewise linear nonlinearities, we show how to efficiently identify all fixed points in polynomial rather than exponential cost in the number of units, making analysis of the inferred dynamics tractable for large RNNs.

We show that the corresponding posterior distribution achieves near-optimal minimax contraction rates, simultaneously adaptive to both intrinsic dimension and smoothness of the underlying function, in a variety of contexts including nonparametric regression, geometric data and Besov spaces. While most works so far need a form of model selection built-in within the prior distribution, a key aspect of our approach is that it does not require to sample hyperparameters to learn the architecture of the network. We also provide variational Bayes counterparts of the results, that show that mean-field variational approximations still benefit from near-optimal theoretical support.">

 This paper proposes a scientific machine learning approach based on Deep Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) to solve ψ-Caputo-type differential equations. The trial solution is constructed based on the Theory of Functional Connection (TFC), and the loss function is built using the L1-based difference and quadrature rule. The learning is handled using the new hybrid average subtraction, standard deviation-based optimizer, and the nonlinear least squares approach. The training error is theoretically obtained, and the generalization error is derived in terms of training error. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the proposed approach. We also validate our scheme on the SIR model.">

        <tr id="We present a new class of fast polylog-linear algorithms based on the theory of structured matrices (in particular low displacement rank) for integrating tensor fields defined on weighted trees. Several applications of the resulting fast tree-field integrators (FTFIs) are presented, including (a) approximation of graph metrics with tree metrics, (b) graph classification, (c) modeling on meshes, and finally (d) Topological Transformers (TTs) (Choromanski et al., 2022) for images. For Topological Transformers, we propose new relative position encoding (RPE) masking mechanisms with as few as three extra learnable parameters per Transformer layer, leading to 1.0-1.5%+ accuracy gains. Importantly, most of FTFIs are exact methods, thus numerically equivalent to their brute-force counterparts. When applied to graphs with thousands of nodes, those exact algorithms provide 5.7-13x speedups. We also provide an extensive theoretical analysis of our methods.">

This capabiltiy of capturing interactions is a key aspect usually missing from most Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, specially if they rely on expensive computations that can be amplified when used on large neural networks. The package provides integration with the main deep learning framework packages in R (tensorflow and torch), allowing an user-friendly application of the NN2Poly algorithm. Furthermore, nn2poly provides implementation of the required weight constraints to be used during the network training in those same frameworks. Other neural networks packages can also be used by including their weights in list format. Polynomials obtained with nn2poly can also be used to predict with new data or be visualized through its own plot method. Simulations are provided exemplifying the usage of the package alongside with a comparison with other approaches available in R to interpret neural networks.">

        <tr id="Introduction. Many mathematical problems are reduced to solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in domains of complex shapes. Existing analytical and numerical methods do not always provide efficient solutions for such problems. Recently, neural networks have been successfully applied to solve PDEs, typically addressing boundary value problems for domains with simple shapes. This paper attempts to construct a neural network capable of effectively solving boundary value problems for domains of complex shapes.Materials and Methods. A method for constructing a neural network to solve the Dirichlet problem for regions of complex shape is proposed. Derivatives of singular solutions of the Laplace equation are accepted as activation functions. Singular points of these solutions are distributed along closed curves encompassing the boundary of the domain. The adjustment of the network weights is reduced to minimizing the root-mean-square error during training.Results. The results of solving Dirichlet problems for various complex-shaped domains are presented. The results are provided in tables, comparing the exact solution and the solution obtained using the neural network. Figures show the domain shapes and the locations of points where the solutions were determined.Discussion and Conclusion. The presented results indicate a good agreement between the obtained solution and the exact one. It is noted that this method can be easily applied to various boundary value problems. Methods for enhancing the efficiency of such neural networks are suggested.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed deep learning has been developed as a novel paradigm for learning physical dynamics recently. While general physics-informed deep learning methods have shown early promise in learning fluid dynamics, they are difficult to generalize in arbitrary time instants in real-world scenario, where the fluid motion can be considered as a time-variant trajectory involved large-scale particles. Inspired by the advantage of diffusion model in learning the distribution of data, we first propose Pi-fusion, a physics-informed diffusion model for predicting the temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field in fluid dynamics. Physics-informed guidance sampling is proposed in the inference procedure of Pi-fusion to improve the accuracy and interpretability of learning fluid dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a training strategy based on reciprocal learning to learn the quasiperiodical pattern of fluid motion and thus improve the generalizability of the model. The proposed approach are then evaluated on both synthetic and real-world dataset, by comparing it with state-of-the-art physics-informed deep learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods for predicting temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field, confirming its strong generalization by drawing probabilistic inference of forward process and physics-informed guidance sampling. The proposed Pi-fusion can also be generalized in learning other physical dynamics governed by partial differential equations.">

        <tr id="Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) serve as the cornerstone for a wide range of scientific endeavours, their solutions weaving through the core of diverse fields such as structural engineering, fluid dynamics, and financial modelling. PDEs are notoriously hard to solve, due to their the intricate nature, and finding solutions to PDEs often exceeds the capabilities of traditional computational approaches. Recent advances in quantum computing have triggered a growing interest from researchers for the design of quantum algorithms for solving PDEs. In this work, we introduce two different architectures of a novel variational quantum algorithm (VQA) with Lagrange polynomial encoding in combination with derivative quantum circuits using the Hadamard test differentiation to approximate the solution of PDEs. To demonstrate the potential of our new VQA, two well-known PDEs are used: the damped mass-spring system from a given initial value and the Poisson equation for periodic, Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. It is shown that the proposed new VQA has a reduced gate complexity compared to previous variational quantum algorithms, for a similar or better quality of the solution.">
