        <tr id="We introduce a new family of deep neural network models. Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a black-box differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.">

        <tr id="Continuous deep learning architectures have recently re-emerged as variants of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). The infinite-depth approach offered by these models theoretically bridges the gap between deep learning and dynamical systems; however, deciphering their inner working is still an open challenge and most of their applications are currently limited to the inclusion as generic black-box modules. In this work, we "open the box" and offer a system-theoretic perspective, including state augmentation strategies and robustness, with the aim of clarifying the influence of several design choices on the underlying dynamics. We also introduce novel architectures: among them, a Galerkin-inspired depth-varying parameter model and neural ODEs with data-controlled vector fields.">

        <tr id="We introduce the framework of continuous--depth graph neural networks (GNNs). Graph neural ordinary differential equations (GDEs) are formalized as the counterpart to GNNs where the input-output relationship is determined by a continuum of GNN layers, blending discrete topological structures and differential equations. The proposed framework is shown to be compatible with various static and autoregressive GNN models. Results prove general effectiveness of GDEs: in static settings they offer computational advantages by incorporating numerical methods in their forward pass; in dynamic settings, on the other hand, they are shown to improve performance by exploiting the geometry of the underlying dynamics.">

        <tr id="We present Graph Neural Diffusion (GRAND) that approaches deep learning on graphs as a continuous diffusion process and treats Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as discretisations of an underlying PDE. In our model, the layer structure and topology correspond to the discretisation choices of temporal and spatial operators. Our approach allows a principled development of a broad new class of GNNs that are able to address the common plights of graph learning models such as depth, oversmoothing, and bottlenecks. Key to the success of our models are stability with respect to perturbations in the data and this is addressed for both implicit and explicit discretisation schemes. We develop linear and nonlinear versions of GRAND, which achieve competitive results on many standard graph benchmarks.">

        <tr id="The numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) is difficult, having led to a century of research so far. Recently, there have been pushes to build neural--numerical hybrid solvers, which piggy-backs the modern trend towards fully end-to-end learned systems. Most works so far can only generalize over a subset of properties to which a generic solver would be faced, including: resolution, topology, geometry, boundary conditions, domain discretization regularity, dimensionality, etc. In this work, we build a solver, satisfying these properties, where all the components are based on neural message passing, replacing all heuristically designed components in the computation graph with backprop-optimized neural function approximators. We show that neural message passing solvers representationally contain some classical methods, such as finite differences, finite volumes, and WENO schemes. In order to encourage stability in training autoregressive models, we put forward a method that is based on the principle of zero-stability, posing stability as a domain adaptation problem. We validate our method on various fluid-like flow problems, demonstrating fast, stable, and accurate performance across different domain topologies, equation parameters, discretizations, etc., in 1D and 2D.">

        <tr id="We propose Graph-Coupled Oscillator Networks (GraphCON), a novel framework for deep learning on graphs. It is based on discretizations of a second-order system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which model a network of nonlinear controlled and damped oscillators, coupled via the adjacency structure of the underlying graph. The flexibility of our framework permits any basic GNN layer (e.g. convolutional or attentional) as the coupling function, from which a multi-layer deep neural network is built up via the dynamics of the proposed ODEs. We relate the oversmoothing problem, commonly encountered in GNNs, to the stability of steady states of the underlying ODE and show that zero-Dirichlet energy steady states are not stable for our proposed ODEs. This demonstrates that the proposed framework mitigates the oversmoothing problem. Moreover, we prove that GraphCON mitigates the exploding and vanishing gradients problem to facilitate training of deep multi-layer GNNs. Finally, we show that our approach offers competitive performance with respect to the state-of-the-art on a variety of graph-based learning tasks.">

        <tr id="Effective data-driven PDE forecasting methods often rely on fixed spatial and / or temporal discretizations. This raises limitations in real-world applications like weather prediction where flexible extrapolation at arbitrary spatiotemporal locations is required. We address this problem by introducing a new data-driven approach, DINo, that models a PDE's flow with continuous-time dynamics of spatially continuous functions. This is achieved by embedding spatial observations independently of their discretization via Implicit Neural Representations in a small latent space temporally driven by a learned ODE. This separate and flexible treatment of time and space makes DINo the first data-driven model to combine the following advantages. It extrapolates at arbitrary spatial and temporal locations; it can learn from sparse irregular grids or manifolds; at test time, it generalizes to new grids or resolutions. DINo outperforms alternative neural PDE forecasters in a variety of challenging generalization scenarios on representative PDE systems.">

This work applies KANs as the backbone of a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework, generalizing their use to the time-dependent and temporal grid-sensitive cases often seen in dynamical systems and scientific machine learning applications. The proposed KAN-ODEs retain the flexible dynamical system modeling framework of Neural ODEs while leveraging the many benefits of KANs compared to MLPs, including higher accuracy and faster neural scaling, stronger interpretability and generalizability, and lower parameter counts. First, we quantitatively demonstrated these improvements in a comprehensive study of the classical Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model. We then showcased the KAN-ODE framework's ability to learn symbolic source terms and complete solution profiles in higher-complexity and data-lean scenarios including wave propagation and shock formation, the complex Schr\"odinger equation, and the Allen-Cahn phase separation equation. The successful training of KAN-ODEs, and their improved performance compared to traditional Neural ODEs, implies significant potential in leveraging this novel network architecture in myriad scientific machine learning applications for discovering hidden physics and predicting dynamic evolution.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promising potential for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using deep learning. 

However, PINNs face training difficulties for evolutionary PDEs, particularly for dynamical systems whose solutions exhibit multi-scale or turbulent behavior over time.

The reason is that PINNs may violate the temporal causality property since all the temporal features in the PINNs loss are trained simultaneously. 

This paper proposes to use implicit time differencing schemes to enforce temporal causality, and use transfer learning to sequentially update the PINNs in space as surrogates for PDE solutions in different time frames.

The evolving PINNs are better able to capture the varying complexities of the evolutionary equations, while only requiring minor updates between adjacent time frames.

Our method is theoretically proven to be convergent if the time step is small and each PINN in different time frames is well-trained.

In addition, we provide state-of-the-art (SOTA) numerical results for a variety of benchmarks for which existing PINNs formulations may fail or be inefficient.

We demonstrate that the proposed method improves the accuracy of PINNs approximation for evolutionary PDEs and improves efficiency by a factor of 4–40x.

Such problems range from weather prediction to the analysis of disease propagation and video prediction. Modern techniques for the solution of these problems typically combine Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) architecture with a time prediction mechanism. However, oftentimes, such approaches underperform in the long-range propagation of information and lack explainability. In this work, we introduce a physically inspired architecture for the solution of such problems. Namely, we propose to augment CNNs with advection by designing a novel semi-Lagrangian push operator. We show that the proposed operator allows for the non-local transformation of information compared with standard convolutional kernels. We then complement it with Reaction and Diffusion neural components to form a network that mimics the Reaction-Advection-Diffusion equation, in high dimensions.

In particular, for stiff problems, ETD methods are a method of choice. We propose an extension of the class of ETD algorithms to matrix-valued dynamical equations.

Although benefiting from favourable properties of NeFs such as grid-agnosticity and space-time-continuous dynamics modelling, this approach limits the ability to impose known constraints of the PDE on the solutions -- e.g. symmetries or boundary conditions -- in favour of modelling flexibility. Instead, we propose a space-time continuous NeF-based solving framework that - by preserving geometric information in the latent space - respects known symmetries of the PDE. We show that modelling solutions as flows of pointclouds over the group of interest $G$ improves generalization and data-efficiency. We validated that our framework readily generalizes to unseen spatial and temporal locations, as well as geometric transformations of the initial conditions - where other NeF-based PDE forecasting methods fail - and improve over baselines in a number of challenging geometries.">

The introduction of the Physical Information Neural Network (PINN) and the Ordinary Dierential Equation (ODENet) network layer enables deep learning technology to more accurately simulate and predict scientic phenomena. This study shows that by embedding an ODE-Net network layer in a physical information neural network (PINN), the tting accuracy and generalization performance of the model can be signicantly improved. Experimental results show that compared with traditional numerical methods and fully connected neural networks, this model combined with deep learning technology not only shows higher accuracy when solving partial dierential equations, but also exhibits faster convergence speed and stronger adaptability.

        <tr id="The deep operator network (DeepONet) is a popular neural operator architecture that has shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by using deep neural networks to map between infinite-dimensional function spaces. In the absence of labeled datasets, we utilize the PDE residual loss to learn the physical system, an approach known as physics-informed DeepONet. This method faces significant computational challenges, primarily due to the curse of dimensionality, as the computational cost increases exponentially with finer discretization. In this paper, we introduce the Separable DeepONet framework to address these challenges and improve scalability for high-dimensional PDEs. Our approach involves a factorization technique where sub-networks handle individual one-dimensional coordinates, thereby reducing the number of forward passes and the size of the Jacobian matrix. By using forward-mode automatic differentiation, we further optimize the computational cost related to the Jacobian matrix. As a result, our modifications lead to a linear scaling of computational cost with discretization density, making Separable DeepONet suitable for high-dimensional PDEs. We validate the effectiveness of the separable architecture through three benchmark PDE models: the viscous Burgers equation, Biot's consolidation theory, and a parametrized heat equation. In all cases, our proposed framework achieves comparable or improved accuracy while significantly reducing computational time compared to conventional DeepONet. These results demonstrate the potential of Separable DeepONet in efficiently solving complex, high-dimensional PDEs, advancing the field of physics-informed machine learning.">

We also introduce distributed EDNN (D-EDNN) by spatially partitioning the global domain into several elements and assigning individual EDNNs to each element to solve the local evolution of the PDE. The networks then exchange the solution and fluxes at their interfaces, similar to flux-reconstruction methods, and ensure that the PDE dynamics are accurately preserved between neighboring elements. Together C-EDNN and D-EDNN form the general class of Multi-EDNN methods.

Despite the popularity of neural operators, their use to predict solution functions over a domain given only data over the boundary (such as a spatially varying Dirichlet boundary condition) remains unexplored. In this paper, we refer to such problems as boundary-to-domain problems; they have a wide range of applications in areas such as fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, heat transfer etc. We present a novel FNO-based architecture, named Lifting Product FNO (or LP-FNO) which can map arbitrary boundary functions defined on the lower-dimensional boundary to a solution in the entire domain. Specifically, two FNOs defined on the lower-dimensional boundary are lifted into the higher dimensional domain using our proposed lifting product layer.

Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method (FEM), suffer from long run times and large memory consumption. On the other hand, approaches based on graph neural networks are faster but still suffer from long computation times on dense graphs, which are often required for high-fidelity simulations. Our model, GIOROM or Graph Interaction Operator for Reduced-Order Modeling, learns temporal dynamics within a reduced-order setting, capturing spatial features from a highly sparse graph representation of the input and generalizing to arbitrary spatial locations during inference. The model is geometry-aware and discretization-agnostic and can generalize to different initial conditions, velocities, and geometries after training. We show that point clouds of the order of 100,000 points can be inferred from sparse graphs with $\sim$1000 points, with negligible change in computation time. We empirically evaluate our model on elastic solids, Newtonian fluids, Non-Newtonian fluids, Drucker-Prager granular flows, and von Mises elastoplasticity. On these benchmarks, our approach results in a 25$\times$ speedup compared to other neural network-based physics simulators while delivering high-fidelity predictions of complex physical systems and showing better performance on most benchmarks.

The autoencoder is coupled with the time integration scheme from a traditional deep least-squares Petrov-Galerkin projection and provides the first deployment of a graph autoencoder into a PMOR framework. The presented graph autoencoder is constructed with a two-part process that consists of (1) generating a hierarchy of reduced graphs to emulate the compressive abilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and (2) training a message passing operation at each step in the hierarchy of reduced graphs to emulate the filtering process of a CNN. The resulting framework provides improved flexibility over traditional CNN-based autoencoders because it is extendable to unstructured meshes. To highlight the capabilities of the proposed framework, which is named geometric deep least-squares Petrov-Galerkin (GD-LSPG), we benchmark the method on a one-dimensional Burgers' equation problem with a structured mesh and demonstrate the flexibility of GD-LSPG by deploying it to a two-dimensional Euler equations model that uses an unstructured mesh.

We investigate the universal approximation properties of SA-NODEs for dynamical systems from both a theoretical and a numerical perspective. Within the assumption of a finite-time horizon, under general hypotheses we establish an asymptotic approximation result, demonstrating that the error vanishes as the number of parameters goes to infinity. Under additional regularity assumptions, we further specify this convergence rate in relation to the number of parameters, utilizing quantitative approximation results in the Barron space. Based on the previous result, we prove an approximation rate for transport equations by their neural counterparts. Our numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of SA-NODEs in capturing the dynamics of various ODE systems and transport equations. Additionally, we compare SA-NODEs with vanilla NODEs, highlighting the superior performance and reduced complexity of our approach.">

        <tr id="Deep Operator Networks (DeepOnets) have revolutionized the domain of scientific machine learning for the solution of the inverse problem for dynamical systems. However, their implementation necessitates optimizing a high-dimensional space of parameters and hyperparameters. This fact, along with the requirement of substantial computational resources, poses a barrier to achieving high numerical accuracy. Here, inpsired by DeepONets and to address the above challenges, we present Random Projection-based Operator Networks (RandONets): shallow networks with random projections that learn linear and nonlinear operators. The implementation of RandONets involves: (a) incorporating random bases, thus enabling the use of shallow neural networks with a single hidden layer, where the only unknowns are the output weights of the network's weighted inner product; this reduces dramatically the dimensionality of the parameter space; and, based on this, (b) using established least-squares solvers (e.g., Tikhonov regularization and preconditioned QR decomposition) that offer superior numerical approximation properties compared to other optimization techniques used in deep-learning. In this work, we prove the universal approximation accuracy of RandONets for approximating nonlinear operators and demonstrate their efficiency in approximating linear nonlinear evolution operators (right-hand-sides (RHS)) with a focus on PDEs. We show, that for this particular task, RandONets outperform, both in terms of numerical approximation accuracy and computational cost, the ``vanilla"DeepOnets.">

It is often necessary to compute the solutions or a function of the solutions to a parametric PDE in multiple scenarios corresponding to different parameters of this PDE. This process often requires resolving the PDEs from scratch, which is time-consuming. To better employ existing simulations for the PDEs, we propose a framework for finding solutions to parabolic PDEs across different scenarios by meta-learning an underlying base distribution. We build upon this base distribution to propose a method for computing solutions to parametric PDEs under different parameter settings. Finally, we illustrate the application of the proposed methods through extensive experiments in generative modeling, stochastic control, and finance. The empirical results suggest that the proposed approach improves generalization to solving PDEs under new parameter regimes.">

While training is cheap, samples are generated via simulation, which is more expensive than one-step models like GANs. To close this gap, we introduce flow map matching -- an algorithm that learns the two-time flow map of an underlying ordinary differential equation. The approach leads to an efficient few-step generative model whose step count can be chosen a-posteriori to smoothly trade off accuracy for computational expense. Leveraging the stochastic interpolant framework, we introduce losses for both direct training of flow maps and distillation from pre-trained (or otherwise known) velocity fields. Theoretically, we show that our approach unifies many existing few-step generative models, including consistency models, consistency trajectory models, progressive distillation, and neural operator approaches, which can be obtained as particular cases of our formalism. With experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 32x32, we show that flow map matching leads to high-quality samples with significantly reduced sampling cost compared to diffusion or stochastic interpolant methods.">

Our model can provide solutions for different values of PDE parameters without any need for retraining the network. The training is carried out in a self-supervised manner, similar to pretraining approaches applied in language and vision tasks. We hypothesize that the model is in effect learning a family of operators (for multiple parameters) mapping the initial condition to the solution of the PDE at any future time step t. We compare this approach with the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and demonstrate that it can generalize over the space of PDE parameters, despite having a higher prediction error for individual parameter values compared to the FNO. We show that performance on a specific parameter can be improved by finetuning the model with very small amounts of data. We also demonstrate that the model scales with data as well as model size.">

By introducing a Least Squares solver for the weights of the last layer of the neural network, we improve the convergence of the loss during training in most practical scenarios. This work analyzes the computational cost of the resulting hybrid Least-Squares/Gradient-Descent optimizer and explains how to implement it efficiently. In particular, we show that a traditional implementation based on backward-mode automatic differentiation leads to a prohibitively expensive algorithm. To remedy this, we propose using either forward-mode automatic differentiation or an ultraweak-type scheme that avoids the differentiation of trial functions in the discrete weak formulation. The proposed alternatives are up to 100 times faster than the traditional one, recovering a computational cost-per-iteration similar to that of a conventional gradient-descent-based optimizer alone. To support our analysis, we derive computational estimates and conduct numerical experiments in one- and two-dimensional problems.">

Moreover, it allows us to propose novel numerical methods for solving the transport task and thus sampling from complicated targets without the need for the normalization constant or data samples. We employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate the respective PDE solutions, implying both conceptional and computational advantages. In particular, PINNs allow for simulation- and discretization-free optimization and can be trained very efficiently, leading to significantly better mode coverage in the sampling task compared to alternative methods.

Gaussian process analogues to classic PDE simulation methods have recently emerged as a framework to construct fully probabilistic estimates of all these types of uncertainty. So far, much of this work focused on theoretical foundations, and as such is not particularly data efficient or scalable.

        <tr id="In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of deep operator networks (DeepONets) in solving both forward and inverse problems of partial differential equations (PDEs) on unknown manifolds. By unknown manifolds, we identify the manifold by a set of randomly sampled data point clouds that are assumed to lie on or close to the manifold. When the loss function incorporates the physics, resulting in the so-called physics-informed DeepONets (PI-DeepONets), we approximate the differentiation terms in the PDE by an appropriate operator approximation scheme. For the second-order elliptic PDE with a nontrivial diffusion coefficient, we approximate the differentiation term with one of these methods: the Diffusion Maps (DM), the Radial Basis Functions (RBF), and the Generalized Moving Least Squares (GMLS) methods. For the GMLS approximation, which is more flexible for problems with boundary conditions, we derive the theoretical error bound induced by the approximate differentiation. Numerically, we found that DeepONet is accurate for various types of diffusion coefficients, including linear, exponential, piecewise linear, and quadratic functions, for linear and semi-linear PDEs with/without boundaries. When the number of observations is small, PI-DeepONet trained with sufficiently large samples of PDE constraints produces more accurate approximations than DeepONet. For the inverse problem, we incorporate PI-DeepONet in a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework to estimate the diffusion coefficient from noisy solutions of the PDEs measured at a finite number of point cloud data. Numerically, we found that PI-DeepONet provides accurate approximations comparable to those obtained by a more expensive method that directly solves the PDE on the proposed diffusion coefficient in each MCMC iteration.">

        <tr id="We present the hidden-layer concatenated physics informed neural network (HLConcPINN) method, which combines hidden-layer concatenated feed-forward neural networks, a modified block time marching strategy, and a physics informed approach for approximating partial differential equations (PDEs). We analyze the convergence properties and establish the error bounds of this method for two types of PDEs: parabolic (exemplified by the heat and Burgers' equations) and hyperbolic (exemplified by the wave and nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations). We show that its approximation error of the solution can be effectively controlled by the training loss for dynamic simulations with long time horizons. The HLConcPINN method in principle allows an arbitrary number of hidden layers not smaller than two and any of the commonly-used smooth activation functions for the hidden layers beyond the first two, with theoretical guarantees. This generalizes several recent neural-network techniques, which have theoretical guarantees but are confined to two hidden layers in the network architecture and the $\tanh$ activation function. Our theoretical analyses subsequently inform the formulation of appropriate training loss functions for these PDEs, leading to physics informed neural network (PINN) type computational algorithms that differ from the standard PINN formulation. Ample numerical experiments are presented based on the proposed algorithm to validate the effectiveness of this method and confirm aspects of the theoretical analyses.">

The introduction of a fractional score function allows us to transform the FPL equation into a second-order partial differential equation without fractional Laplacian and thus can be readily solved with standard physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). We propose two methods to obtain a fractional score function: fractional score matching (FSM) and score-fPINN for fitting the fractional score function. While FSM is more cost-effective, it relies on known conditional distributions. On the other hand, score-fPINN is independent of specific stochastic differential equations (SDEs) but requires evaluating the PINN model's derivatives, which may be more costly. We conduct our experiments on various SDEs and demonstrate numerical stability and effectiveness of our method in dealing with high-dimensional problems, marking a significant advancement in addressing the CoD in FPL equations.">

In this work, we propose a novel operator learning based hybrid Newton's method to accelerate this solution of the nonlinear time step system for stiff time-evolution nonlinear equations. We propose a targeted learning strategy which facilitates robust unsupervised learning in an offline phase and provides a highly efficient initialisation for the Newton iteration leading to consistent acceleration of Newton's method.

        <tr id=""AI for Science"aims to solve fundamental scientific problems using AI techniques. As most physical phenomena can be described as Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) , approximating their solutions using neural networks has evolved as a central component of scientific-ML. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is the general method that has evolved for this task but its training is well-known to be very unstable. In this work we explore the possibility of changing the model being trained from being just a neural network to being a non-linear transformation of it - one that algebraically includes the boundary/initial conditions. This reduces the number of terms in the loss function than the standard PINN losses. We demonstrate that our modification leads to significant performance gains across a range of benchmark tasks, in various dimensions and without having to tweak the training algorithm. Our conclusions are based on conducting hundreds of experiments, in the fully unsupervised setting, over multiple linear and non-linear PDEs set to exactly solvable scenarios, which lends to a concrete measurement of our performance gains in terms of order(s) of magnitude lower fractional errors being achieved, than by standard PINNs.

KNOs use parameterized, closed-form, finitely-smooth, and compactly-supported kernels with trainable sparsity parameters within the integral operators to significantly reduce the number of parameters that must be learned relative to existing neural operators. Moreover, the use of quadrature for numerical integration endows the KNO with geometric flexibility that enables operator learning on irregular geometries. Numerical results demonstrate that on existing benchmarks the training and test accuracy of KNOs is higher than popular operator learning techniques while using at least an order of magnitude fewer trainable parameters. KNOs thus represent a new paradigm of low-memory, geometrically-flexible, deep operator learning, while retaining the implementation simplicity and transparency of traditional kernel methods from both scientific computing and machine learning.">

Despite these advances, our understanding of how pretraining affects neural operators is still limited; studies generally propose tailored architectures and datasets that make it challenging to compare or examine different pretraining frameworks. To address this, we compare various pretraining methods without optimizing architecture choices to characterize pretraining dynamics on different models and datasets as well as to understand its scaling and generalization behavior. We find that pretraining is highly dependent on model and dataset choices, but in general transfer learning or physics-based pretraining strategies work best. In addition, pretraining performance can be further improved by using data augmentations. Lastly, pretraining is additionally beneficial when fine-tuning in scarce data regimes or when generalizing to downstream data similar to the pretraining distribution.

With the growing interest in architectures that process NNs, a recurring design principle has permeated the field: adhering to the permutation symmetries arising from the connectionist structure of NNs. $\textit{However, are these the sole symmetries present in NN parameterizations}$? Zooming into most practical activation functions (e.g. sine, ReLU, tanh) answers this question negatively and gives rise to intriguing new symmetries, which we collectively refer to as $\textit{scaling symmetries}$, that is, non-zero scalar multiplications and divisions of weights and biases. In this work, we propose $\textit{Scale Equivariant Graph MetaNetworks - ScaleGMNs}$, a framework that adapts the Graph Metanetwork (message-passing) paradigm by incorporating scaling symmetries and thus rendering neuron and edge representations equivariant to valid scalings. We introduce novel building blocks, of independent technical interest, that allow for equivariance or invariance with respect to individual scalar multipliers or their product and use them in all components of ScaleGMN. Furthermore, we prove that, under certain expressivity conditions, ScaleGMN can simulate the forward and backward pass of any input feedforward neural network. Experimental results demonstrate that our method advances the state-of-the-art performance for several datasets and activation functions, highlighting the power of scaling symmetries as an inductive bias for NN processing.">

Neural operators are deep neural networks designed to learn nontrivial solution operators of such differential equations from data. As for all statistical models, the predictions of these models are imperfect and exhibit errors. Such errors are particularly difficult to spot in the complex nonlinear behaviour of dynamical systems. We introduce a new framework for approximate Bayesian uncertainty quantification in neural operators using function-valued Gaussian processes. Our approach can be interpreted as a probabilistic analogue of the concept of currying from functional programming and provides a practical yet theoretically sound way to apply the linearized Laplace approximation to neural operators. In a case study on Fourier neural operators, we show that, even for a discretized input, our method yields a Gaussian closure--a structured Gaussian process posterior capturing the uncertainty in the output function of the neural operator, which can be evaluated at an arbitrary set of points. The method adds minimal prediction overhead, can be applied post-hoc without retraining the neural operator, and scales to large models and datasets. We showcase the efficacy of our approach through applications to different types of partial differential equations.">

The correction term is determined by further training with the sample points in the added subinterval. Secondly, by designing an extrapolation control function with special characteristics and combining it with the correction term, we construct a new neural network architecture whose network parameters are coupled with the time variable, which we call the extrapolation-driven network architecture. Based on this architecture, using a single neural network, we can obtain the overall PINN solution of the whole domain with the following two characteristics: (1) it completely inherits the local solution of the interval obtained from the previous training, (2) at the interval node, it strictly maintains the continuity and smoothness that the true solution has. The extrapolation-driven network architecture allows us to divide a large time domain into multiple subintervals and solve the time-dependent PDEs one by one in chronological order. This training scheme respects the causality principle and effectively overcomes the difficulties of the conventional PINN method in solving the evolution equation on a large time domain. Numerical experiments verify the performance of our proposed method.">

        <tr id="Recent advances in deep learning for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) have introduced physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which integrate machine learning with physical laws. Physics-informed convolutional neural networks (PICNNs) extend PINNs by leveraging CNNs for enhanced generalization and efficiency. However, current PICNNs depend on manual design, and inappropriate designs may not effectively solve PDEs. Furthermore, due to the diversity of physical problems, the ideal network architectures and loss functions vary across different PDEs. It is impractical to find the optimal PICNN architecture and loss function for each specific physical problem through extensive manual experimentation. To surmount these challenges, this paper uses automated machine learning (AutoML) to automatically and efficiently search for the loss functions and network architectures of PICNNs. We introduce novel search spaces for loss functions and network architectures and propose a two-stage search strategy. The first stage focuses on searching for factors and residual adjustment operations that influence the loss function, while the second stage aims to find the best CNN architecture. Experimental results show that our automatic searching method significantly outperforms the manually-designed model on multiple datasets.">

Neural operators are a new type of models that can map between function spaces, allowing trained models to emulate the solution operators of PDEs. This paper introduces a novel Fourier neural operator with a multigrid architecture (MgFNO). The MgFNO combines the frequency principle of deep neural networks (DNNs) with the multigrid idea for solving linear systems. To speed up the training process of the FNO, a three-layer V-cycle multigrid architecture is used. This architecture involves training the model multiple times on a coarse grid and then transferring it to a fine grid to accelerate the training of the model. The DNN-based solver learns the solution from low to high frequency, while the multigrid method acquires the solution from high to low frequency. Note that the FNO is a resolution-invariant solution operator, therefore the corresponding calculations are greatly simplified. Finally, experiments are conducted on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and Navier-Stokes equation. The results demonstrate that the proposed MgFNO outperforms the traditional Fourier neural operator.">

To address this issue, we propose and formulate the Physical Trajectory Residual Learning (DeltaPhi), which learns to predict the physical residuals between the pending solved trajectory and a known similar auxiliary trajectory. First, we transform the direct operator mapping between input-output function fields in original training data to residual operator mapping between input function pairs and output function residuals. Next, we learn the surrogate model for the residual operator mapping based on existing neural operator networks. Additionally, we design helpful customized auxiliary inputs for efficient optimization. Through extensive experiments, we conclude that, compared to direct learning, physical residual learning is preferred for PDE solving.">

Numerical differentiation (ND) using the finite difference (FD) method is efficient in physics-constrained designs, even in parameterized settings, often employing body-fitted block-structured grids for complex flow cases. However, convolution operators in CNNs for finite differences are typically limited to single-block grids. To address this, we use graphs and graph networks (GNs) to learn flow representations across multi-block structured grids. We propose a graph convolution-based finite difference method (GC-FDM) to train GNs in a physics-constrained manner, enabling differentiable finite difference operations on graph unstructured outputs. Our goal is to solve parametric steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for flows around a backward-facing step, a circular cylinder, and double cylinders, using multi-block structured grids. Comparing our method to a CFD solver under various boundary conditions, we demonstrate improved training efficiency and accuracy, achieving a minimum relative error of $10^{-3}$ in velocity field prediction and a 20\% reduction in training cost compared to PINNs.">

        <tr id="The most advanced diffusion models have recently adopted increasingly deep stacked networks (e.g., U-Net or Transformer) to promote the generative emergence capabilities of vision generation models similar to large language models (LLMs). However, progressively deeper stacked networks will intuitively cause numerical propagation errors and reduce noisy prediction capabilities on generative data, which hinders massively deep scalable training of vision generation models. In this paper, we first uncover the nature that neural networks being able to effectively perform generative denoising lies in the fact that the intrinsic residual unit has consistent dynamic property with the input signal's reverse diffusion process, thus supporting excellent generative abilities. Afterwards, we stand on the shoulders of two common types of deep stacked networks to propose a unified and massively scalable Neural Residual Diffusion Models framework (Neural-RDM for short), which is a simple yet meaningful change to the common architecture of deep generative networks by introducing a series of learnable gated residual parameters that conform to the generative dynamics. Experimental results on various generative tasks show that the proposed neural residual models obtain state-of-the-art scores on image's and video's generative benchmarks. Rigorous theoretical proofs and extensive experiments also demonstrate the advantages of this simple gated residual mechanism consistent with dynamic modeling in improving the fidelity and consistency of generated content and supporting large-scale scalable training.

This architecture is highly flexible, allowing the evaluation of the solution field at any location within the desired domain. However, it imposes a strict constraint on the input space, requiring all input functions to be discretized at the same locations; this limits its practical applications. In this work, we introduce a Resolution Independent Neural Operator (RINO) that provides a framework to make DeepONet resolution-independent, enabling it to handle input functions that are arbitrarily, but sufficiently finely, discretized. To this end, we propose a dictionary learning algorithm to adaptively learn a set of appropriate continuous basis functions, parameterized as implicit neural representations (INRs), from the input data. These basis functions are then used to project arbitrary input function data as a point cloud onto an embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions) with dimensionality equal to the dictionary size, which can be directly used by DeepONet without any architectural changes. In particular, we utilize sinusoidal representation networks (SIRENs) as our trainable INR basis functions. We demonstrate the robustness and applicability of RINO in handling arbitrarily (but sufficiently richly) sampled input functions during both training and inference through several numerical examples.">

As a popular tool in recent years, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) was proposed to perform a mesh-free, semi-supervised learning with high flexibility. This paper explores the integration of Lie symmetry groups with deep learning techniques to enhance the numerical solutions of fundamental solution in PDE. We propose a novel approach that combines the strengths of PINN and Lie group theory to address the computational inefficiencies in traditional methods. By incorporating the linearized symmetric condition (LSC) derived from Lie symmetries into PINNs, we introduce a new type of residual loss with lower order of derivative needed to calculate. This integration allows for significant reductions in computational costs and improvements in solution precision. Numerical simulation shows that our method can achieve up to a 50\% reduction in training time while maintaining good accuracy. Additionally, we provide a general theoretical framework to identify invariant infinitesimal generators for arbitrary Cauchy problems. This unsupervised algorithm does not require prior numerical solutions, making it both practical and efficient for various applications.

We find that, for the inverse problem to converge to the correct solution, the different components of the loss function (data misfit, initial conditions, boundary conditions and residual of the transport equation) need to be weighted adaptively as a function of the training iteration (epoch). Similarly, gradients of trainable parameters are scaled at each epoch accordingly.

First, a novel deep learning approach named the weak Latent Dynamics Model (wLDM) is developed for learning generic nonlinear dynamics with control. Leveraging the weak form, the wLDM enables more numerically stable and computationally efficient training as well as more accurate prediction, when compared to conventional methods such as neural ordinary differential equations. Building upon the wLDM framework, we propose the weak Graph Koopman Bilinear Form (wGKBF) model, which integrates geometric deep learning and Koopman theory to learn latent space dynamics for networked systems, especially for the challenging cases having multiple timescales. The effectiveness of the wLDM framework and wGKBF model are demonstrated on three example systems of increasing complexity - a controlled double pendulum, the stiff Brusselator dynamics, and an electrified aircraft energy system. These numerical examples show that the wLDM and wGKBF achieve superior predictive accuracy and training efficiency as compared to baseline models. Parametric studies provide insights into the effects of hyperparameters in the weak form. The proposed framework shows the capability to efficiently capture control-dependent dynamics in these systems, including stiff dynamics and multi-physics interactions, offering a promising direction for learning control-oriented models of complex networked systems.">

Of articles that use ML to solve a fluid-related PDE and claim to outperform a standard numerical method, we determine that 79% (60/76) compare to a weak baseline. Second, we find evidence that reporting biases, especially outcome reporting bias and publication bias, are widespread. We conclude that ML-for-PDE solving research is overoptimistic: weak baselines lead to overly positive results, while reporting biases lead to underreporting of negative results. To a large extent, these issues appear to be caused by factors similar to those of past reproducibility crises: researcher degrees of freedom and a bias towards positive results.

We provide theoretical guarantees for SepONet using the universal approximation theorem and validate its performance through comprehensive benchmarking against PI-DeepONet. Our results demonstrate that for the 1D time-dependent advection equation, when targeting a mean relative $\ell_{2}$ error of less than 6% on 100 unseen variable coefficients, SepONet provides up to $112 \times$ training speed-up and $82 \times$ GPU memory usage reduction compared to PI-DeepONet. Similar computational advantages are observed across various partial differential equations, with SepONet's efficiency gains scaling favorably as problem complexity increases.

        <tr id="Diffusion models excel in high-quality generation but suffer from slow inference due to iterative sampling. While recent methods have successfully transformed diffusion models into one-step generators, they neglect model size reduction, limiting their applicability in compute-constrained scenarios. This paper aims to develop small, efficient one-step diffusion models based on the powerful rectified flow framework, by exploring joint compression of inference steps and model size. The rectified flow framework trains one-step generative models using two operations, reflow and distillation. Compared with the original framework, squeezing the model size brings two new challenges: (1) the initialization mismatch between large teachers and small students during reflow; (2) the underperformance of naive distillation on small student models. To overcome these issues, we propose Annealing Reflow and Flow-Guided Distillation, which together comprise our SlimFlow framework. With our novel framework, we train a one-step diffusion model with an FID of 5.02 and 15.7M parameters, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art one-step diffusion model (FID=6.47, 19.4M parameters) on CIFAR10. On ImageNet 64$\times$64 and FFHQ 64$\times$64, our method yields small one-step diffusion models that are comparable to larger models, showcasing the effectiveness of our method in creating compact, efficient one-step diffusion models.">

        <tr id="Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a robust framework for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by approximating their solutions via neural networks and imposing physics-based constraints on the loss function. Traditionally, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) are the neural network of choice, and significant progress has been made in optimizing their training. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) were introduced as a viable alternative, with the potential of offering better interpretability and efficiency while requiring fewer parameters. In this paper, we present a fast JAX-based implementation of grid-dependent Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) for solving PDEs. We propose an adaptive training scheme for PIKANs, incorporating known MLP-based PINN techniques, introducing an adaptive state transition scheme to avoid loss function peaks between grid updates, and proposing a methodology for designing PIKANs with alternative basis functions. Through comparative experiments we demonstrate that these adaptive features significantly enhance training efficiency and solution accuracy. Our results illustrate the effectiveness of PIKANs in improving performance for PDE solutions, highlighting their potential as a superior alternative in scientific and engineering applications.">

Our framework is flexible, allowing us to solve non-linear, coupled, and chaotic dynamical systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on systems including a free particle, a particle in a gravitational field, a classical pendulum, and the H\'enon--Heiles system (a pair of coupled harmonic oscillators with a non-linear perturbation, used in celestial mechanics). Our results show that deep neural networks can successfully approximate solutions to these problems, producing trajectories which conserve physical properties such as energy and those with stationary action.

        <tr id="Partial differential equations (PDEs) are extensively utilized for modeling various physical phenomena. These equations often depend on certain parameters, necessitating either the identification of optimal parameters or solving the equation across multiple parameters to understand how a structure might react under different conditions. Performing an exhaustive search over the parameter space requires solving the PDE multiple times, which is generally impractical. To address this challenge, Reduced Order Models (ROMs) are constructed from a snapshot dataset comprising parameter-solution pairs. ROMs facilitate the rapid solving of PDEs for new parameters. Recently, Deep Learning ROMs (DL-ROMs) have been introduced as a new method to obtain ROM. Additionally, the PDE of interest may depend on the domain, which can be characterized by parameters or measurements and may evolve with the system, requiring parametrization for ROM construction. In this paper, we develop a Deep-ROM capable of extracting and efficiently utilizing domain parametrization. Unlike traditional domain parametrization methods, our approach does not require user-defined control points and can effectively handle domains with varying numbers of components. Moreover, our model can derive meaningful parametrization even when a domain mesh is unavailable, a common scenario in biomedical applications. Our work leverages Deep Neural Networks to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the PDE and the domain characteristic function.">

Here, we present a model in which learnable grids of B-Spline activation functions are replaced by grids of re-weighted sine functions. We show that this leads to better or comparable numerical performance to B-Spline KAN models on the MNIST benchmark, while also providing a substantial speed increase on the order of 4-8 times.">

While the attached geometric structure has proven to be useful in analyzing heterophily and oversmoothing, so far the methods by which the sheaf is computed do not always guarantee a good performance in such settings. In this work, drawing inspiration from opinion dynamics concepts, we propose two novel sheaf learning approaches that (i) provide a more intuitive understanding of the involved structure maps, (ii) introduce a useful inductive bias for heterophily and oversmoothing, and (iii) infer the sheaf in a way that does not scale with the number of features, thus using fewer learnable parameters than existing methods. In our evaluation, we show the limitations of the real-world benchmarks used so far on SNNs, and design a new synthetic task -- leveraging the symmetries of n-dimensional ellipsoids -- that enables us to better assess the strengths and weaknesses of sheaf-based models. Our extensive experimentation on these novel datasets reveals valuable insights into the scenarios and contexts where SNNs in general -- and our proposed approaches in particular -- can be beneficial.">

We address limitations of previous work on data-driven flow map learning in the sense that we focus on noisy and limited data to move toward data collection scenarios in real-world applications. Leveraging recent work on modeling PDEs in modal and nodal spaces, we present a neural network structure that is suitable for PDE modeling with noisy and limited data available only on a subset of the state variables or computational domain. In particular, spatial grid-point measurements are reduced using a learned linear transformation, after which the dynamics are learned in this reduced basis before being transformed back out to the nodal space. This approach yields a drastically reduced parameterization of the neural network compared with previous flow map models for nodal space learning. This primarily allows for smaller training data sets, but also enables reduced training times.">

More recent data-driven techniques use neural networks to enable nonlinear projections. Whilst those often enable stronger compression, they may have redundant parameters and lead to suboptimal latent dimensionality. To overcome these, we propose a multistep algorithm that induces sparsity in the encoder-decoder networks for effective reduction in the number of parameters and additional compression of the latent space. This algorithm starts with sparsely initialized a network and training it using linearized Bregman iterations. These iterations have been very successful in computer vision and compressed sensing tasks, but have not yet been used for reduced-order modelling. After the training, we further compress the latent space dimensionality by using a form of proper orthogonal decomposition. Last, we use a bias propagation technique to change the induced sparsity into an effective reduction of parameters. We apply this algorithm to three representative PDE models: 1D diffusion, 1D advection, and 2D reaction-diffusion. Compared to conventional training methods like Adam, the proposed method achieves similar accuracy with 30% less parameters and a significantly smaller latent space.">

        <tr id="The large spatial/temporal/frequency scale of geoscience and remote-sensing datasets causes memory issues when using convolutional neural networks for (sub-) surface data segmentation. Recently developed fully reversible or fully invertible networks can mostly avoid memory limitations by recomputing the states during the backward pass through the network. This results in a low and fixed memory requirement for storing network states, as opposed to the typical linear memory growth with network depth. This work focuses on a fully invertible network based on the telegraph equation. While reversibility saves the major amount of memory used in deep networks by the data, the convolutional kernels can take up most memory if fully invertible networks contain multiple invertible pooling/coarsening layers. We address the explosion of the number of convolutional kernels by combining fully invertible networks with layers that contain the convolutional kernels in a compressed form directly. A second challenge is that invertible networks output a tensor the same size as its input. This property prevents the straightforward application of invertible networks to applications that map between different input-output dimensions, need to map to outputs with more channels than present in the input data, or desire outputs that decrease/increase the resolution compared to the input data. However, we show that by employing invertible networks in a non-standard fashion, we can still use them for these tasks. Examples in hyperspectral land-use classification, airborne geophysical surveying, and seismic imaging illustrate that we can input large data volumes in one chunk and do not need to work on small patches, use dimensionality reduction, or employ methods that classify a patch to a single central pixel.">

Most GNNs typically consist of a sequence of neighborhood aggregation (a.k.a., message passing) layers. Within each of these layers, the representation of each node is updated from an aggregation and transformation of its neighbours representations at the previous layer. The upper bound for the expressive power of message passing GNNs was reached through the use of MLPs as a transformation, due to their universal approximation capabilities. However, MLPs suffer from well-known limitations, which recently motivated the introduction of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). KANs rely on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, rendering them a promising alternative to MLPs. In this work, we compare the performance of KANs against that of MLPs in graph learning tasks. We perform extensive experiments on node classification, graph classification and graph regression datasets. Our preliminary results indicate that while KANs are on-par with MLPs in classification tasks, they seem to have a clear advantage in the graph regression tasks.

This representation is then discretized as a manifold of implicit neural representations where the feedforward neural network architecture has a low rank structure.

Unlike grid-based schemes, it does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and is therefore suitable for high dimensional problems.

Furthermore, its predictions may disobey the governing physical laws and are difficult to interpret. Physics-guided DL aims to integrate first-principled physical knowledge into data-driven methods.

        <tr id="A common technique for ameliorating the computational costs of running large neural models is sparsification, or the removal of neural connections during training. Sparse models are capable of maintaining the high accuracy of state of the art models, while functioning at the cost of more parsimonious models. The structures which underlie sparse architectures are, however, poorly understood and not consistent between differently trained models and sparsification schemes. In this paper, we propose a new technique for sparsification of recurrent neural nets (RNNs), called moduli regularization, in combination with magnitude pruning. Moduli regularization leverages the dynamical system induced by the recurrent structure to induce a geometric relationship between neurons in the hidden state of the RNN. By making our regularizing term explicitly geometric, we provide the first, to our knowledge, a priori description of the desired sparse architecture of our neural net. We verify the effectiveness of our scheme for navigation and natural language processing RNNs. Navigation is a structurally geometric task, for which there are known moduli spaces, and we show that regularization can be used to reach 90% sparsity while maintaining model performance only when coefficients are chosen in accordance with a suitable moduli space. Natural language processing, however, has no known moduli space in which computations are performed. Nevertheless, we show that moduli regularization induces more stable recurrent neural nets with a variety of moduli regularizers, and achieves high fidelity models at 98% sparsity.">

The recent advent of Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) indicates that there is potential to revisit and enhance the previously MLP-based PINNs. Compared to MLPs, KANs offer interpretability and require fewer parameters. PDEs can be described in various forms, such as strong form, energy form, and inverse form. While mathematically equivalent, these forms are not computationally equivalent, making the exploration of different PDE formulations significant in computational physics. Thus, we propose different PDE forms based on KAN instead of MLP, termed Kolmogorov-Arnold-Informed Neural Network (KINN). We systematically compare MLP and KAN in various numerical examples of PDEs, including multi-scale, singularity, stress concentration, nonlinear hyperelasticity, heterogeneous, and complex geometry problems. Our results demonstrate that KINN significantly outperforms MLP in terms of accuracy and convergence speed for numerous PDEs in computational solid mechanics, except for the complex geometry problem. This highlights KINN's potential for more efficient and accurate PDE solutions in AI for PDEs.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a significant advancement in scientific machine learning by integrating fundamental physical laws into their architecture through loss functions. PINNs have been successfully applied to solve various forward and inverse problems in partial differential equations (PDEs). However, a notable challenge can emerge during the early training stages when solving inverse problems. Specifically, data losses remain high while PDE residual losses are minimized rapidly, thereby exacerbating the imbalance between loss terms and impeding the overall efficiency of PINNs. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel framework termed data-guided physics-informed neural networks (DG-PINNs). The DG-PINNs framework is structured into two distinct phases: a pre-training phase and a fine-tuning phase. In the pre-training phase, a loss function with only the data loss is minimized in a neural network. In the fine-tuning phase, a composite loss function, which consists of the data loss, PDE residual loss, and, if available, initial and boundary condition losses, is minimized in the same neural network. Notably, the pre-training phase ensures that the data loss is already at a low value before the fine-tuning phase commences. This approach enables the fine-tuning phase to converge to a minimal composite loss function with fewer iterations compared to existing PINNs. To validate the effectiveness, noise-robustness, and efficiency of DG-PINNs, extensive numerical investigations are conducted on inverse problems related to several classical PDEs, including the heat equation, wave equation, Euler--Bernoulli beam equation, and Navier--Stokes equation. The numerical results demonstrate that DG-PINNs can accurately solve these inverse problems and exhibit robustness against noise in training data.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we combine convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with reduced order modeling (ROM) for efficient simulations of multiscale problems. These problems are modeled by partial differential equations with high-dimensional random inputs. The proposed method involves two separate CNNs: Basis CNNs and Coefficient CNNs (Coef CNNs), which correspond to two main parts of ROM. The method is called CNN-based ROM. The former one learns input-specific basis functions from the snapshots of fine-scale solutions. An activation function, inspired by Galerkin projection, is utilized at the output layer to reconstruct fine-scale solutions from the basis functions. Numerical results show that the basis functions learned by the Basis CNNs resemble data, which help to significantly reduce the number of the basis functions. Moreover, CNN-based ROM is less sensitive to data fluctuation caused by numerical errors than traditional ROM. Since the tests of Basis CNNs still need fine-scale stiffness matrix and load vector, it can not be directly applied to nonlinear problems. The Coef CNNs can be applied to nonlinear problems and designed to determine the coefficients for linear combination of basis functions. In addition, two applications of CNN-based ROM are presented, including predicting MsFEM basis functions within oversampling regions and building accurate surrogates for inverse problems.">

Indeed, a wide number of DLWP architectures -- based on various backbones, including U-Net, Transformer, Graph Neural Network (GNN), and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) -- have demonstrated their potential at forecasting atmospheric states. However, due to differences in training protocols, forecast horizons, and data choices, it remains unclear which (if any) of these methods and architectures are most suitable for weather forecasting and for future model development. Here, we step back and provide a detailed empirical analysis, under controlled conditions, comparing and contrasting the most prominent DLWP models, along with their backbones. We accomplish this by predicting synthetic two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes and real-world global weather dynamics. In terms of accuracy, memory consumption, and runtime, our results illustrate various tradeoffs. For example, on synthetic data, we observe favorable performance of FNO; and on the real-world WeatherBench dataset, our results demonstrate the suitability of ConvLSTM and SwinTransformer for short-to-mid-ranged forecasts. For long-ranged weather rollouts of up to 365 days, we observe superior stability and physical soundness in architectures that formulate a spherical data representation, i.e., GraphCast and Spherical FNO. In addition, we observe that all of these model backbones ``saturate,'' i.e., none of them exhibit so-called neural scaling, which highlights an important direction for future work on these and related models.">

We employ the supervised learning and design two loss functions, one with the mean squared error and the other with the mean squared logarithmic error, where the WENO3-JS weights are computed as the labels. Each loss function consists of two components where the first component compares the difference between the weights from the neural network and WENO3-JS weights, while the second component matches the output weights of the neural network and the linear weights. The former of the loss function enforces the neural network to follow the WENO properties, implying that there is no need for the post-processing layer. Additionally the latter leads to better performance around discontinuities. As a neural network structure, we choose the shallow neural network (SNN) for computational efficiency with the Delta layer consisting of the normalized undivided differences. These constructed WENO3-SNN schemes show the outperformed results in one-dimensional examples and improved behavior in two-dimensional examples, compared with the simulations from WENO3-JS and WENO3-Z.">

Traditional methods often fail to capture the detailed features necessary for accurate modeling, presenting a significant challenge in scientific computing. In response, we introduce the Multiwavelet-based Algebraic Multigrid Neural Operator (M2NO), a novel deep learning framework that synergistically combines multiwavelet transformations and algebraic multigrid (AMG) techniques. By exploiting the inherent similarities between these two approaches, M2NO overcomes their individual limitations and enhances precision and flexibility across various PDE benchmarks. Employing Multiresolution Analysis (MRA) with high-pass and low-pass filters, the model executes hierarchical decomposition to accurately delineate both global trends and localized details within PDE solutions, supporting adaptive data representation at multiple scales. M2NO also automates node selection and adeptly manages complex boundary conditions through its multiwavelet-based operators. Extensive evaluations on a diverse array of PDE datasets with different boundary conditions confirm M2NO's superior performance. Furthermore, M2NO excels in handling high-resolution and super-resolution tasks, consistently outperforming competing models and demonstrating robust adaptability in complex computational scenarios.">

        <tr id="Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved exceptional performance across various fields by learning complex nonlinear mappings from large-scale datasets. However, they encounter challenges such as high computational costs and limited interpretability. To address these issues, hybrid approaches that integrate physics with AI are gaining interest. This paper introduces a novel physics-based AI model called the"Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Network", which treats the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NLSE) as a general-purpose trainable model for learning complex patterns including nonlinear mappings and memory effects from data. Existing physics-informed machine learning methods use neural networks to approximate the solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs). In contrast, our approach directly treats the PDE as a trainable model to obtain general nonlinear mappings that would otherwise require neural networks. As a type of physics-AI symbiosis, it offers a more interpretable and parameter-efficient alternative to traditional black-box neural networks, achieving comparable or better accuracy in some time series classification tasks while significantly reducing the number of required parameters. Notably, the trained Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Network is interpretable, with all parameters having physical meanings as properties of a virtual physical system that transforms the data to a more separable space. This interpretability allows for insight into the underlying dynamics of the data transformation process. Applications to time series forecasting have also been explored. While our current implementation utilizes the NLSE, the proposed method of using physics equations as trainable models to learn nonlinear mappings from data is not limited to the NLSE and may be extended to other master equations of physics.">

The PDE component focuses on reaction-diffusion processes, while the ODE component addresses transmission via ion channels on the cell's or organelle's membrane. However, analytically determining the underlying equations for ion channels is highly challenging due to the complexity and unknown factors inherent in biological processes. Therefore, we employ deep neural networks (DNNs) to model the open probability of ion channels, a task that can be intricate when approached with ODEs. This technique also reduces the number of unknowns required to model the open probability. When trained with valid data, the same neural network architecture can be used for different ion channels, such as sodium, potassium, and calcium. Furthermore, based on the given data, we can build more physiologically reasonable DNN models that can be customized. Subsequently, we integrated the DNN model into calcium dynamics in neurons with endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in a hybrid model that combines PDEs and DNNs. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the flexibility and advantages of the PDE-DNN model.">

In this paper, we design a symmetry-enhanced deep neural network (sDNN) which makes the architecture of neural networks invariant under the finite group through expanding the dimensions of weight matrixes and bias vectors in each hidden layers by the order of finite group if the group has matrix representations, otherwise extending the set of input data and the hidden layers except for the first hidden layer by the order of finite group. However, the total number of training parameters is only about one over the order of finite group of the original PINN size due to the symmetric architecture of sDNN. Furthermore, we give special forms of weight matrixes and bias vectors of sDNN, and rigorously prove that the architecture itself is invariant under the finite group and the sDNN has the universal approximation ability to learn the function keeping the finite group. Numerical results show that the sDNN has strong predicted abilities in and beyond the sampling domain and performs far better than the vanilla PINN with fewer training points and simpler architecture.">

        <tr id="While the impressive performance of modern neural networks is often attributed to their capacity to efficiently extract task-relevant features from data, the mechanisms underlying this rich feature learning regime remain elusive, with much of our theoretical understanding stemming from the opposing lazy regime. In this work, we derive exact solutions to a minimal model that transitions between lazy and rich learning, precisely elucidating how unbalanced layer-specific initialization variances and learning rates determine the degree of feature learning. Our analysis reveals that they conspire to influence the learning regime through a set of conserved quantities that constrain and modify the geometry of learning trajectories in parameter and function space. We extend our analysis to more complex linear models with multiple neurons, outputs, and layers and to shallow nonlinear networks with piecewise linear activation functions. In linear networks, rapid feature learning only occurs with balanced initializations, where all layers learn at similar speeds. While in nonlinear networks, unbalanced initializations that promote faster learning in earlier layers can accelerate rich learning. Through a series of experiments, we provide evidence that this unbalanced rich regime drives feature learning in deep finite-width networks, promotes interpretability of early layers in CNNs, reduces the sample complexity of learning hierarchical data, and decreases the time to grokking in modular arithmetic. Our theory motivates further exploration of unbalanced initializations to enhance efficient feature learning.">

This paper extends the use of these features to compositional GPs involving linear transformations. In particular, we introduce Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) -based RKHS Fourier features that allow for adaptive amplitude and phase modulation through convolution operations. This convolutional formulation relates our work to recently proposed deep latent force models, a multi-layer structure designed for modelling nonlinear dynamical systems. By embedding these adjustable RKHS Fourier features within a doubly stochastic variational inference framework, our model exhibits improved predictive performance across various regression tasks.">

Specifically, we consider the case of plane linear elasticity and, by leveraging the Kolosov-Muskhelishvili representation of the solution in terms of holomorphic potentials, we train a complex-valued neural network to fulfill stress and displacement boundary conditions while automatically satisfying the governing equations. This is achieved by designing the network to return only approximations that inherently satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann conditions through specific choices of layers and activation functions. To ensure generality, we provide a universal approximation theorem guaranteeing that, under basic assumptions, the proposed holomorphic neural networks can approximate any holomorphic function. Furthermore, we suggest a new tailored weight initialization technique to mitigate the issue of vanishing/exploding gradients. Compared to the standard PINN approach, noteworthy benefits of the proposed method for the linear elasticity problem include a more efficient training, as evaluations are needed solely on the boundary of the domain, lower memory requirements, due to the reduced number of training points, and $C^\infty$ regularity of the learned solution. Several benchmark examples are used to verify the correctness of the obtained PIHNN approximations, the substantial benefits over traditional PINNs, and the possibility to deal with non-trivial, multiply-connected geometries via a domain-decomposition strategy.">

In both settings, the underlying clustering approach can be implemented via graph pooling operators, which often rely on classical tools from Graph Theory. In this work, we introduce a graph pooling operator (ORC-Pool), which utilizes a characterization of the graph's geometry via Ollivier's discrete Ricci curvature and an associated geometric flow. Previous Ricci flow based clustering approaches have shown great promise across several domains, but are by construction unable to account for similarity structure encoded in the node attributes.

Specifically, for a given batch size $m$, the generalization error under QMC methods exhibits a convergence rate of $O(m^{-1+\varepsilon})$, where $\varepsilon$ can be made arbitrarily small. This rate is notably more favorable than that of the traditional Monte Carlo (MC) methods, which is $O(m^{-1/2+\varepsilon})$. Our theoretical analysis shows that the generalization error under QMC methods achieves a higher order of convergence than their MC counterparts.

Using insights from the Maximal Update Parameterization, we determine the optimal scaling for initialization and learning rates of these unconventional layers. Finally, we measure the scaling laws of different structures to compare how quickly their performance improves with compute.

By applying a graph decomposition scheme to an undirected Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) built from the training dataset, our method generates node clusters encoding conditional dependence between training samples. Biasing sampling towards more important clusters allows smaller mini-batches and training datasets, improving training speed and accuracy. We additionally fuse an efficient robustness metric with residual losses to determine regions requiring additional sampling.

        <tr id="Simulating spatiotemporal turbulence with high fidelity remains a cornerstone challenge in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) due to its intricate multiscale nature and prohibitive computational demands. Traditional approaches typically employ closure models, which attempt to represent small-scale features in an unresolved manner. However, these methods often sacrifice accuracy and lose high-frequency/wavenumber information, especially in scenarios involving complex flow physics. In this paper, we introduce an innovative neural differentiable modeling framework designed to enhance the predictability and efficiency of spatiotemporal turbulence simulations. Our approach features differentiable hybrid modeling techniques that seamlessly integrate deep neural networks with numerical PDE solvers within a differentiable programming framework, synergizing deep learning with physics-based CFD modeling. Specifically, a hybrid differentiable neural solver is constructed on a coarser grid to capture large-scale turbulent phenomena, followed by the application of a Bayesian conditional diffusion model that generates small-scale turbulence conditioned on large-scale flow predictions. Two innovative hybrid architecture designs are studied, and their performance is evaluated through comparative analysis against conventional large eddy simulation techniques with physics-based subgrid-scale closures and purely data-driven neural solvers. The findings underscore the potential of the neural differentiable modeling framework to significantly enhance the accuracy and computational efficiency of turbulence simulations. This study not only demonstrates the efficacy of merging deep learning with physics-based numerical solvers but also sets a new precedent for advanced CFD modeling techniques, highlighting the transformative impact of differentiable programming in scientific computing.">

JKOnet* minimizes a simple quadratic loss, runs at lightspeed, and drastically outperforms other baselines in practice.

        <tr id="Solving complex Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) accurately and efficiently is an essential and challenging problem in all scientific and engineering disciplines. Mesh movement methods provide the capability to improve the accuracy of the numerical solution without increasing the overall mesh degree of freedom count. Conventional sophisticated mesh movement methods are extremely expensive and struggle to handle scenarios with complex boundary geometries. However, existing learning-based methods require re-training from scratch given a different PDE type or boundary geometry, which limits their applicability, and also often suffer from robustness issues in the form of inverted elements. In this paper, we introduce the Universal Mesh Movement Network (UM2N), which -- once trained -- can be applied in a non-intrusive, zero-shot manner to move meshes with different size distributions and structures, for solvers applicable to different PDE types and boundary geometries. UM2N consists of a Graph Transformer (GT) encoder for extracting features and a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based decoder for moving the mesh. We evaluate our method on advection and Navier-Stokes based examples, as well as a real-world tsunami simulation case. Our method outperforms existing learning-based mesh movement methods in terms of the benchmarks described above. In comparison to the conventional sophisticated Monge-Amp\`ere PDE-solver based method, our approach not only significantly accelerates mesh movement, but also proves effective in scenarios where the conventional method fails.

        <tr id="It is a challenging topic in applied mathematics to solve high-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Standard approximation methods for nonlinear PDEs suffer under the curse of dimensionality (COD) in the sense that the number of computational operations of the approximation method grows at least exponentially in the PDE dimension and with such methods it is essentially impossible to approximately solve high-dimensional PDEs even when the fastest currently available computers are used. However, in the last years great progress has been made in this area of research through suitable deep learning (DL) based methods for PDEs in which deep neural networks (DNNs) are used to approximate solutions of PDEs. Despite the remarkable success of such DL methods in simulations, it remains a fundamental open problem of research to prove (or disprove) that such methods can overcome the COD in the approximation of PDEs. However, there are nowadays several partial error analysis results for DL methods for high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs in the literature which prove that DNNs can overcome the COD in the sense that the number of parameters of the approximating DNN grows at most polynomially in both the reciprocal of the prescribed approximation accuracy $\varepsilon>0$ and the PDE dimension $d\in\mathbb{N}$. In the main result of this article we prove that for all $T,p\in(0,\infty)$ it holds that solutions $u_d\colon[0,T]\times\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$, of semilinear heat equations with Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities can be approximated in the $L^p$-sense on space-time regions without the COD by DNNs with the rectified linear unit (ReLU), the leaky ReLU, or the softplus activation function. In previous articles similar results have been established not for space-time regions but for the solutions $u_d(T,\cdot)$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$, at the terminal time $T$.">

These GP neurons exhibit robust non-linear modelling capabilities while using few parameters and can be easily and fully integrated in a feed-forward network structure. They provide inherent uncertainty estimates to the model prediction and can be trained directly on the log-likelihood objective function, without needing variational lower bounds or approximations. In the context of MNIST classification, a model based on GP-KAN of 80 thousand parameters achieved 98.5% prediction accuracy, compared to current state-of-the-art models with 1.5 million parameters.">

Traditional deep learning methods, such as multilayer perceptrons (MLP), offer depth but lack ability to integrate structural characteristics of deep learning architectures with non-parametric flexibility of kernel methods. To address this, deep kernel learning (DKL) was introduced, where inputs to a base kernel are transformed using a deep learning architecture. These kernels can replace standard kernels, allowing both expressive power and scalability. The advent of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) has generated considerable attention and discussion among researchers in scientific domain. In this paper, we introduce a scalable deep kernel using KAN (DKL-KAN) as an effective alternative to DKL using MLP (DKL-MLP). Our approach involves simultaneously optimizing these kernel attributes using marginal likelihood within a Gaussian process framework. We analyze two variants of DKL-KAN for a fair comparison with DKL-MLP: one with same number of neurons and layers as DKL-MLP, and another with approximately same number of trainable parameters. To handle large datasets, we use kernel interpolation for scalable structured Gaussian processes (KISS-GP) for low-dimensional inputs and KISS-GP with product kernels for high-dimensional inputs. The efficacy of DKL-KAN is evaluated in terms of computational training time and test prediction accuracy across a wide range of applications. Additionally, the effectiveness of DKL-KAN is also examined in modeling discontinuities and accurately estimating prediction uncertainty. The results indicate that DKL-KAN outperforms DKL-MLP on datasets with a low number of observations. Conversely, DKL-MLP exhibits better scalability and higher test prediction accuracy on datasets with large number of observations.">

For these problems, linear approximation methods (proper orthogonal decomposition and reduced basis method) are not suitable, as the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay is slow, leading to inefficient and inaccurate reduced order models. There are few non-linear approaches to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. In this work, we use a neural-network shift augmented transformation technique, that employs automatic-shit detection and detects the optimal non-linear transformation of the full-order model solution manifold $\mathcal{M}$. We exploit a deep-learning framework to derive parameter-dependent bijective mapping between the manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. It consists of two neural networks, 1) ShiftNet, to employ automatic-shift detection by learning the shift-operator, which finds the optimal shifts for numerous snapshots of the full-order solution manifold, to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay, and 2) InterpNet, which learns the reference configuration and can reconstruct the field values of the same, for each shifted grid distribution. We construct non-intrusive reduced order models on the resulting transformed linear subspaces and employ automatic-shift detection for predictions. We test our methodology on advection-dominated problems, such as 1D travelling waves, 2D isentropic convective vortex and 2D two-phase flow test cases.

        <tr id="Laplace approximations are popular techniques for endowing deep networks with epistemic uncertainty estimates as they can be applied without altering the predictions of the neural network, and they scale to large models and datasets. While the choice of prior strongly affects the resulting posterior distribution, computational tractability and lack of interpretability of weight space typically limit the Laplace approximation to isotropic Gaussian priors, which are known to cause pathological behavior as depth increases. As a remedy, we directly place a prior on function space. More precisely, since Lebesgue densities do not exist on infinite-dimensional function spaces, we have to recast training as finding the so-called weak mode of the posterior measure under a Gaussian process (GP) prior restricted to the space of functions representable by the neural network. Through the GP prior, one can express structured and interpretable inductive biases, such as regularity or periodicity, directly in function space, while still exploiting the implicit inductive biases that allow deep networks to generalize. After model linearization, the training objective induces a negative log-posterior density to which we apply a Laplace approximation, leveraging highly scalable methods from matrix-free linear algebra. Our method provides improved results where prior knowledge is abundant, e.g., in many scientific inference tasks. At the same time, it stays competitive for black-box regression and classification tasks where neural networks typically excel.">

        <tr id="We propose a meta-learning method for modeling Hamiltonian dynamics from a limited number of data. Although Hamiltonian neural networks have been successfully used for modeling dynamics that obey the energy conservation law, they require many data to achieve high performance. The proposed method meta-learns our neural network-based model using datasets in various dynamical systems, such that our model can predict vector fields of unseen systems. In our model, a system representation is inferred from given small data using an encoder network. Then, the system-specific vector field is predicted by modeling the Hamiltonian using a Gaussian process (GP) with neural network-based mean and kernel functions that depend on the inferred system representation. This GP-based Hamiltonian allows us to analytically obtain predictions that are adapted to small data while imposing the constraint of the conservation law. The neural networks are shared across systems, which enables us to learn knowledge from multiple systems, and use it for unseen systems. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods for predicting dynamics from a small number of observations in target systems.">

In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used as statistical emulators for those numerical models. However, since CNNs operate on regular grids, they cannot represent the refined meshes and computational efficiency of finite-element numerical models. Therefore, instead of CNNs, this study adopts an equivariant graph convolutional network (EGCN) as an emulator for the ice sheet dynamics modeling. EGCN reproduces ice thickness and velocity changes in the Helheim Glacier, Greenland, and Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica, with 260 times and 44 times faster computation time, respectively. Compared to the traditional CNN and graph convolutional network, EGCN shows outstanding accuracy in thickness prediction near fast ice streams by preserving the equivariance to the translation and rotation of graphs.">

It aims to estimate the state of a potentially large system, such as the atmosphere, from sparse observations, supplemented by prior physical knowledge. The size of the systems involved and the complexity of the underlying physical equations make it a challenging task from a computational point of view. Neural networks represent a promising method of emulating the physics at low cost, and therefore have the potential to considerably improve and accelerate data assimilation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning approach where the physical system is modeled as a sequence of coarse-to-fine Gaussian prior distributions parametrized by a neural network. This allows us to define an assimilation operator, which is trained in an end-to-end fashion to minimize the reconstruction error on a dataset with different observation processes. We illustrate our approach on chaotic dynamical physical systems with sparse observations, and compare it to traditional variational data assimilation methods.">

        <tr id="We introduce a method that combines neural operators, physics-informed machine learning, and standard numerical methods for solving PDEs. The proposed approach extends each of the aforementioned methods and unifies them within a single framework. We can parametrically solve partial differential equations in a data-free manner and provide accurate sensitivities, meaning the derivatives of the solution space with respect to the design space. These capabilities enable gradient-based optimization without the typical sensitivity analysis costs, unlike adjoint methods that scale directly with the number of response functions. Our Finite Operator Learning (FOL) approach uses an uncomplicated feed-forward neural network model to directly map the discrete design space (i.e. parametric input space) to the discrete solution space (i.e. finite number of sensor points in the arbitrary shape domain) ensuring compliance with physical laws by designing them into loss functions. The discretized governing equations, as well as the design and solution spaces, can be derived from any well-established numerical techniques. In this work, we employ the Finite Element Method (FEM) to approximate fields and their spatial derivatives. Subsequently, we conduct Sobolev training to minimize a multi-objective loss function, which includes the discretized weak form of the energy functional, boundary conditions violations, and the stationarity of the residuals with respect to the design variables. Our study focuses on the steady-state heat equation within heterogeneous materials that exhibits significant phase contrast and possibly temperature-dependent conductivity. The network's tangent matrix is directly used for gradient-based optimization to improve the microstructure's heat transfer characteristics. ...">

        <tr id="Computing Jacobians with automatic differentiation is ubiquitous in many scientific domains such as machine learning, computational fluid dynamics, robotics and finance. Even small savings in the number of computations or memory usage in Jacobian computations can already incur massive savings in energy consumption and runtime. While there exist many methods that allow for such savings, they generally trade computational efficiency for approximations of the exact Jacobian. In this paper, we present a novel method to optimize the number of necessary multiplications for Jacobian computation by leveraging deep reinforcement learning (RL) and a concept called cross-country elimination while still computing the exact Jacobian. Cross-country elimination is a framework for automatic differentiation that phrases Jacobian accumulation as ordered elimination of all vertices on the computational graph where every elimination incurs a certain computational cost. We formulate the search for the optimal elimination order that minimizes the number of necessary multiplications as a single player game which is played by an RL agent. We demonstrate that this method achieves up to 33% improvements over state-of-the-art methods on several relevant tasks taken from diverse domains. Furthermore, we show that these theoretical gains translate into actual runtime improvements by providing a cross-country elimination interpreter in JAX that can efficiently execute the obtained elimination orders.">

The forward modeling of the elastic wave equation in the time domain by the staggered-grid difference schemes can be reformulated as a process of a recurrent neural network (RNN). As a result, the FWI problem is equivalent to neural network training, and the parameter of RNN coincides with the model parameter of inversion. Furthermore, a variety of stochastic optimizers including Adgrad, RMSprop, Adam, Nadam and Admax in neural networks can be applied in the training process. The gradient of the objective function with the model parameters is computed by the technique of automatic differentiation instead of the adjoint-state method in the traditional FWI. A new objective function of FWI is also proposed. Compared to the traditional FWI methods, the developed FWI using tools of neural networks has a relatively good robustness. Numerical computations and comparisons with Marmousi model for two and three parameters simultaneous inversion are completed. The results show that the algorithms except Adgrad can yield good inversion results. The FWI framework developed in this paper has potential applications for other complex partial equations.">

However, these methods often encounter challenges when dealing with problems involving complex geometries. Machine learning-based methods, on the other hand, are mesh-free, thus providing a promising alternative. In particular, operator learning methods have been proposed to learn the mapping from the input space to the solution space, enabling rapid inference of solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) once trained. In this work, we address the parametric elliptic interface problem. Building upon the deep operator network (DeepONet), we propose an extended interface deep operator network (XI-DeepONet). XI-DeepONet exhibits three unique features: (1) The interface geometry is incorporated into the neural network as an additional input, enabling the network to infer solutions for new interface geometries once trained; (2) The level set function associated with the interface geometry is treated as the input, on which the solution mapping is continuous and can be effectively approximated by the deep operator network; (3) The network can be trained without any input-output data pairs, thus completely avoiding the need for meshes of any kind, directly or indirectly. We conduct a comprehensive series of numerical experiments to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method.">

        <tr id="The advancement of scientific machine learning (ML) techniques has led to the development of methods for approximating solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) with increased efficiency and accuracy. Automatic differentiation has played a pivotal role in this progress, enabling the creation of physics-informed neural networks (PINN) that integrate relevant physics into machine learning models. PINN have shown promise in approximating the solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, overcoming the limitations of traditional numerical discretization methods. However, challenges such as local minima and long training times persist, motivating the exploration of domain decomposition techniques to improve it. Previous domain decomposition models have introduced spatial and temporal domain decompositions but have yet to fully address issues of smoothness and regularity of global solutions. In this study, we present a novel domain decomposition approach for PINN, termed domain-discretized PINN (DD-PINN), which incorporates complementary loss functions, subdomain-specific transformer networks (TRF), and independent optimization within each subdomain. By enforcing continuity and differentiability through interface constraints and leveraging the Sobolev (H 1) norm of the mean squared error (MSE), rather than the Euclidean norm (L 2), DD-PINN enhances solution regularity and accuracy. The inclusion of TRF in each subdomain facilitates feature extraction and improves convergence rates, as demonstrated through simulations of threetest problems: steady-state flow in a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity, the time-dependent cylinder wake, and the viscous Burgers equation. Numerical comparisons highlight the effectiveness of DD-PINN in preserving global solution regularity and accurately approximating complex phenomena, marking a significant advancement over previous domain decomposition methods within the PINN framework.">

However, current PINN frameworks are not sufficiently mature for real-world ODE systems, especially those with extreme multi-scale behavior such as mosquito population dynamical modelling. In this research, we propose a PINN framework with several improvements for forward and inverse problems for ODE systems with a case study application in modelling the dynamics of mosquito populations. The framework tackles the gradient imbalance and stiff problems posed by mosquito ordinary differential equations. The method offers a simple but effective way to resolve the time causality issue in PINNs by gradually expanding the training time domain until it covers entire domain of interest. As part of a robust evaluation, we conduct experiments using simulated data to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach.

        <tr id="The Path-dependent Neural Jump ODE (PD-NJ-ODE) is a model for online prediction of generic (possibly non-Markovian) stochastic processes with irregular (in time) and potentially incomplete (with respect to coordinates) observations. It is a model for which convergence to the $L^2$-optimal predictor, which is given by the conditional expectation, is established theoretically. Thereby, the training of the model is solely based on a dataset of realizations of the underlying stochastic process, without the need of knowledge of the law of the process. In the case where the underlying process is deterministic, the conditional expectation coincides with the process itself. Therefore, this framework can equivalently be used to learn the dynamics of ODE or PDE systems solely from realizations of the dynamical system with different initial conditions. We showcase the potential of our method by applying it to the chaotic system of a double pendulum. When training the standard PD-NJ-ODE method, we see that the prediction starts to diverge from the true path after about half of the evaluation time. In this work we enhance the model with two novel ideas, which independently of each other improve the performance of our modelling setup. The resulting dynamics match the true dynamics of the chaotic system very closely. The same enhancements can be used to provably enable the PD-NJ-ODE to learn long-term predictions for general stochastic datasets, where the standard model fails. This is verified in several experiments.">

In this paper, we propose a generic asymptotic-preserving multiple-input DeepONet (AP-MIONet) method for solving these two kinetic equations with variable parameters in the high-field regime. Our method aims to tackle two major challenges in this regime: the additional variable parameters introduced by electric fields, and the absence of an explicit local equilibrium, which is a key component of asymptotic-preserving (AP) schemes. We leverage the multiple-input DeepONet (MIONet) architecture to accommodate additional parameters, and formulate the AP loss function by incorporating both the mass conservation law and the original kinetic system. This strategy can avoid reliance on the explicit local equilibrium, preserve the mass and adapt to non-equilibrium states. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method through extensive numerical examples.">

        <tr id="We make the first steps towards diffusion models for unconditional generation of multivariate and Arctic-wide sea-ice states. While targeting to reduce the computational costs by diffusion in latent space, latent diffusion models also offer the possibility to integrate physical knowledge into the generation process. We tailor latent diffusion models to sea-ice physics with a censored Gaussian distribution in data space to generate data that follows the physical bounds of the modelled variables. Our latent diffusion models reach similar scores as the diffusion model trained in data space, but they smooth the generated fields as caused by the latent mapping. While enforcing physical bounds cannot reduce the smoothing, it improves the representation of the marginal ice zone. Therefore, for large-scale Earth system modelling, latent diffusion models can have many advantages compared to diffusion in data space if the significant barrier of smoothing can be resolved.">

        <tr id="Consistency models (CMs) are an emerging class of generative models that offer faster sampling than traditional diffusion models. CMs enforce that all points along a sampling trajectory are mapped to the same initial point. But this target leads to resource-intensive training: for example, as of 2024, training a SoTA CM on CIFAR-10 takes one week on 8 GPUs. In this work, we propose an alternative scheme for training CMs, vastly improving the efficiency of building such models. Specifically, by expressing CM trajectories via a particular differential equation, we argue that diffusion models can be viewed as a special case of CMs with a specific discretization. We can thus fine-tune a consistency model starting from a pre-trained diffusion model and progressively approximate the full consistency condition to stronger degrees over the training process. Our resulting method, which we term Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT), achieves vastly improved training times while indeed improving upon the quality of previous methods: for example, ECT achieves a 2-step FID of 2.73 on CIFAR10 within 1 hour on a single A100 GPU, matching Consistency Distillation trained of hundreds of GPU hours. Owing to this computational efficiency, we investigate the scaling law of CMs under ECT, showing that they seem to obey classic power law scaling, hinting at their ability to improve efficiency and performance at larger scales. Code (https://github.com/locuslab/ect) is available.">

        <tr id="Phase-field models have been widely used to investigate the phase transformation phenomena. However, it is difficult to solve the problems numerically due to their strong nonlinearities and higher-order terms. This work is devoted to solving forward and inverse problems of the phase-field models by a novel deep learning framework named Phase-Field Weak-form Neural Networks (PFWNN), which is based on the weak forms of the phase-field equations. In this framework, the weak solutions are parameterized as deep neural networks with a periodic layer, while the test function space is constructed by functions compactly supported in small regions. The PFWNN can efficiently solve the phase-field equations characterizing the sharp transitions and identify the important parameters by employing the weak forms. It also allows local training in small regions, which significantly reduce the computational cost. Moreover, it can guarantee the residual descending along the time marching direction, enhancing the convergence of the method. Numerical examples are presented for several benchmark problems. The results validate the efficiency and accuracy of the PFWNN. This work also sheds light on solving the forward and inverse problems of general high-order time-dependent partial differential equations.">

In contrast to conventionally studied universal approximation properties under increasing architectures, e.g., in terms of width or depth of the networks, we are concerned with the asymptotic growth of the parameters of approximating networks. Such results are of interest, e.g., for error analysis or consistency results for neural network training. The main result of our work is that, for a ReLU architecture with state of the art approximation error, the realizing parameters grow at most polynomially. The obtained rate with respect to a normalized network size is compared to existing results and is shown to be superior in most cases, in particular for high dimensional input.">

The empirical distribution of the model weights converges to a deterministic measure governed by a McKean-Vlasov nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE). Under L2 regularization, this PDE reduces to a closed set of low-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs), reflecting the evolution of the model performance during the training process. We analyze the fixed point locations and their stability of the ODEs unveiling several interesting findings. First, only the hidden variable's second moment affects feature learnability at the state with uninformative initialization. Second, higher moments influence the probability of feature selection by controlling the attraction region, rather than affecting local stability. Finally, independent noises added in the data argumentation degrade performance but negatively correlated noise can reduces the variance of gradient estimation yielding better performance. Despite of the simplicity of the analyzed model, it exhibits a rich phenomena of training dynamics, paving a way to understand more complex mechanism behind practical large models.">

Their main benefit is better accuracy with fewer training points compared to standard neural networks. These attributes are particularly desirable in the field of computer-aided design, where there is often the need to replace computationally expensive, physics-based models with fast running approximations, known as surrogate models or meta-models. Since a surrogate emulates the original model accurately in near-real time, it yields a speed benefit that can be used to carry out orders of magnitude more function calls quickly. However, in the special case of gradient-enhanced methods, there is the additional value proposition that partial derivatives are accurate, which is a critical property for one important use-case: surrogate-based optimization. This work derives the complete theory and exemplifies its superiority over standard neural nets for surrogate-based optimization.">

Especially chaotic time series that depend on a long history pose an exceptionally difficult problem. While machine learning has shown to be a promising approach for predicting such time series, it either demands long training time and much training data when using deep recurrent neural networks. Alternative, when using a reservoir computing approach it comes with high uncertainty and typically a high number of random initializations and extensive hyper-parameter tuning when using a reservoir computing approach. In this paper, we focus on the reservoir computing approach and propose a new mapping of input data into the reservoir's state space. Furthermore, we incorporate this method in two novel network architectures increasing parallelizability, depth and predictive capabilities of the neural network while reducing the dependence on randomness. For the evaluation, we approximate a set of time series from the Mackey-Glass equation, inhabiting non-chaotic as well as chaotic behavior and compare our approaches in regard to their predictive capabilities to echo state networks and gated recurrent units. For the chaotic time series, we observe an error reduction of up to $85.45\%$ and up to $87.90\%$ in contrast to echo state networks and gated recurrent units respectively. Furthermore, we also observe tremendous improvements for non-chaotic time series of up to $99.99\%$ in contrast to existing approaches.">

        <tr id="Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a methodology for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using a single hidden layer feed-forward neural network. It presets the weight/bias coefficients in the hidden layer with random values, which remain fixed throughout the computation, and uses a linear least squares method for training the parameters of the output layer of the neural network. It is known to be much faster than Physics informed neural networks. However, classical ELM is still computationally expensive when a high level of representation is desired in the solution as this requires solving a large least squares system. In this paper, we propose a nonoverlapping domain decomposition method (DDM) for ELMs that not only reduces the training time of ELMs, but is also suitable for parallel computation. In numerical analysis, DDMs have been widely studied to reduce the time to obtain finite element solutions for elliptic PDEs through parallel computation. Among these approaches, nonoverlapping DDMs are attracting the most attention. Motivated by these methods, we introduce local neural networks, which are valid only at corresponding subdomains, and an auxiliary variable at the interface. We construct a system on the variable and the parameters of local neural networks. A Schur complement system on the interface can be derived by eliminating the parameters of the output layer. The auxiliary variable is then directly obtained by solving the reduced system after which the parameters for each local neural network are solved in parallel. A method for initializing the hidden layer parameters suitable for high approximation quality in large systems is also proposed. Numerical results that verify the acceleration performance of the proposed method with respect to the number of subdomains are presented.">

Many factors have been pointed out as the reason for this phenomenon, including an implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and a possible simplicity bias arising from the neural network architecture. The goal of this paper is to disentangle the factors that influence generalization stemming from optimization and architectural choices by studying random and SGD-optimized networks that achieve zero training error. We experimentally show, in the low sample regime, that overparameterization in terms of increasing width is beneficial for generalization, and this benefit is due to the bias of SGD and not due to an architectural bias. In contrast, for increasing depth, overparameterization is detrimental for generalization, but random and SGD-optimized networks behave similarly, so this can be attributed to an architectural bias.

The RNN-Scaling method modifies the optimization objective by increasing the weight of boundary equations, resulting in a more accurate approximation. We propose the boundary processing techniques on the rectangular domain that enforce the RNN method to satisfy the non-homogeneous Dirichlet and clamped boundary conditions exactly. We further prove that the RNN-BP method is exact for some solutions with specific forms and validate it numerically. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the RNN-BP method is the most accurate among the three methods, the error is reduced by 6 orders of magnitude for some tests.">

In computer-aided engineering (CAE), the ability to handle fine resolutions and large computational models is essential for improving product performance and reducing development costs. However, solving large-scale PDEs, particularly for systems with spatially varying material properties, poses significant computational challenges. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for solving second-order linear PDEs of non-conservative systems with spatially varying parameters, using the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS) method. Our approach transforms those PDEs into ordinary differential equations represented by qubit operators, through spatial discretization using the finite difference method. Then, we provide an algorithm that efficiently constructs the operator corresponding to the spatially varying parameters of PDEs via a logic minimization technique, which reduces the number of terms and subsequently the circuit depth. We also develop a scalable method for realizing a quantum circuit for LCHS, using a tensor-network-based technique, specifically a matrix product state (MPS). We validate our method with applications to the acoustic equation with spatially varying parameters and the dissipative heat equation. Our approach includes a detailed recipe for constructing quantum circuits for PDEs, leveraging efficient encoding of spatially varying parameters of PDEs and scalable implementation of LCHS, which we believe marks a significant step towards advancing quantum computing's role in solving practical engineering problems.">

 We present a variational approach aimed at enhancing the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and more general surrogate models for learning partial differential equations (PDEs). In particular, we extend our formerly introduced notion of Sobolev cubatures to negative orders, enabling the approximation of negative order Sobolev norms. We mathematically prove the effect of negative order Sobolev cubatures in improving the condition number of discrete PDE learning problems, providing balancing scalars that mitigate numerical stiffness issues caused by loss imbalances. Additionally, we consider polynomial surrogate models (PSMs), which maintain the flexibility of PINN formulations while preserving the convexity structure of the PDE operators. The combination of negative order Sobolev cubatures and PSMs delivers well-conditioned discrete optimization problems, solvable via an exponentially fast convergent gradient descent for λ-convex losses. Our theoretical contributions are supported by numerical experiments, addressing linear and non-linear, forward and inverse PDE problems. These experiments show that the Sobolev cubature-based PSMs emerge as the superior state-of-the-art PINN technique.">

However, despite their significant success in various fields, it remains unclear in many aspects how to effectively train PINNs if the solutions of PDEs exhibit stiff behaviors or high frequencies. In this paper, we propose a new method for training PINNs using variable-scaling techniques. This method is simple and it can be applied to a wide range of problems including PDEs with rapidly-varying solutions. Throughout various numerical experiments, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for these problems and confirm that it can significantly improve the training efficiency and performance of PINNs. Furthermore, based on the analysis of the neural tangent kernel (NTK), we will provide theoretical evidence for this phenomenon and show that our methods can indeed improve the performance of PINNs.">

        <tr id="The neutron diffusion equation plays a pivotal role in the analysis of nuclear reactors. Nevertheless, employing the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) method for its solution entails certain limitations. Traditional PINN approaches often utilize fully connected network (FCN) architecture, which is susceptible to overfitting, training instability, and gradient vanishing issues as the network depth increases. These challenges result in accuracy bottlenecks in the solution. In response to these issues, the Residual-based Resample Physics-Informed Neural Network(R2-PINN) is proposed, which proposes an improved PINN architecture that replaces the FCN with a Convolutional Neural Network with a shortcut(S-CNN), incorporating skip connections to facilitate gradient propagation between network layers. Additionally, the incorporation of the Residual Adaptive Resampling (RAR) mechanism dynamically increases sampling points, enhancing the spatial representation capabilities and overall predictive accuracy of the model. The experimental results illustrate that our approach significantly improves the model's convergence capability, achieving high-precision predictions of physical fields. In comparison to traditional FCN-based PINN methods, R2-PINN effectively overcomes the limitations inherent in current methods, providing more accurate and robust solutions for neutron diffusion equations.">

        <tr id="Deep neural networks learn increasingly complex functions over the course of training. Here, we show both empirically and theoretically that learning of the target function is preceded by an early phase in which networks learn the optimal constant solution (OCS) - that is, initial model responses mirror the distribution of target labels, while entirely ignoring information provided in the input. Using a hierarchical category learning task, we derive exact solutions for learning dynamics in deep linear networks trained with bias terms. Even when initialized to zero, this simple architectural feature induces substantial changes in early dynamics. We identify hallmarks of this early OCS phase and illustrate how these signatures are observed in deep linear networks and larger, more complex (and nonlinear) convolutional neural networks solving a hierarchical learning task based on MNIST and CIFAR10. We explain these observations by proving that deep linear networks necessarily learn the OCS during early learning. To further probe the generality of our results, we train human learners over the course of three days on the category learning task. We then identify qualitative signatures of this early OCS phase in terms of the dynamics of true negative (correct-rejection) rates. Surprisingly, we find the same early reliance on the OCS in the behaviour of human learners. Finally, we show that learning of the OCS can emerge even in the absence of bias terms and is equivalently driven by generic correlations in the input data. Overall, our work suggests the OCS as a universal learning principle in supervised, error-corrective learning, and the mechanistic reasons for its prevalence.">

Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the ACLs not only have a remarkable capacity for feature representation with a reduced number of parameters but also attain increased reliability through the analytical formulation of ACKs. Furthermore, ACLs offer a means for neural network interpretation, thereby paving the way for the intrinsic interpretability of neural network. The source code will be published in company with the paper.">

        <tr id="Herein the topics of (natural) gradient descent, data decorrelation, and approximate methods for backpropagation are brought into a dialogue. Natural gradient descent illuminates how gradient vectors, pointing at directions of steepest descent, can be improved by considering the local curvature of loss landscapes. We extend this perspective and show that to fully solve the problem illuminated by natural gradients in neural networks, one must recognise that correlations in the data at any linear transformation, including node responses at every layer of a neural network, cause a non-orthonormal relationship between the model's parameters. To solve this requires a solution to decorrelate inputs at each individual layer of a neural network. We describe a range of methods which have been proposed for decorrelation and whitening of node output, while providing a novel method specifically useful for distributed computing and computational neuroscience. Implementing decorrelation within multi-layer neural networks, we can show that not only is training via backpropagation sped up significantly but also existing approximations of backpropagation, which have failed catastrophically in the past, are made performant once more. This has the potential to provide a route forward for approximate gradient descent methods which have previously been discarded, training approaches for analogue and neuromorphic hardware, and potentially insights as to the efficacy and utility of decorrelation processes in the brain.">

        <tr id="Message passing is the dominant paradigm in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The efficiency of message passing, however, can be limited by the topology of the graph. This happens when information is lost during propagation due to being oversquashed when travelling through bottlenecks. To remedy this, recent efforts have focused on graph rewiring techniques, which disconnect the input graph originating from the data and the computational graph, on which message passing is performed. A prominent approach for this is to use discrete graph curvature measures, of which several variants have been proposed, to identify and rewire around bottlenecks, facilitating information propagation. While oversquashing has been demonstrated in synthetic datasets, in this work we reevaluate the performance gains that curvature-based rewiring brings to real-world datasets. We show that in these datasets, edges selected during the rewiring process are not in line with theoretical criteria identifying bottlenecks. This implies they do not necessarily oversquash information during message passing. Subsequently, we demonstrate that SOTA accuracies on these datasets are outliers originating from sweeps of hyperparameters -- both the ones for training and dedicated ones related to the rewiring algorithm -- instead of consistent performance gains. In conclusion, our analysis nuances the effectiveness of curvature-based rewiring in real-world datasets and brings a new perspective on the methods to evaluate GNN accuracy improvements.">

        <tr id="Infinitely wide or deep neural networks (NNs) with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) parameters have been shown to be equivalent to Gaussian processes. Because of the favorable properties of Gaussian processes, this equivalence is commonly employed to analyze neural networks and has led to various breakthroughs over the years. However, neural networks and Gaussian processes are equivalent only in the limit; in the finite case there are currently no methods available to approximate a trained neural network with a Gaussian model with bounds on the approximation error. In this work, we present an algorithmic framework to approximate a neural network of finite width and depth, and with not necessarily i.i.d. parameters, with a mixture of Gaussian processes with error bounds on the approximation error. In particular, we consider the Wasserstein distance to quantify the closeness between probabilistic models and, by relying on tools from optimal transport and Gaussian processes, we iteratively approximate the output distribution of each layer of the neural network as a mixture of Gaussian processes. Crucially, for any NN and $\epsilon>0$ our approach is able to return a mixture of Gaussian processes that is $\epsilon$-close to the NN at a finite set of input points. Furthermore, we rely on the differentiability of the resulting error bound to show how our approach can be employed to tune the parameters of a NN to mimic the functional behavior of a given Gaussian process, e.g., for prior selection in the context of Bayesian inference. We empirically investigate the effectiveness of our results on both regression and classification problems with various neural network architectures. Our experiments highlight how our results can represent an important step towards understanding neural network predictions and formally quantifying their uncertainty.">

        <tr id="By leveraging the kernel trick in the output space, kernel-induced losses provide a principled way to define structured output prediction tasks for a wide variety of output modalities. In particular, they have been successfully used in the context of surrogate non-parametric regression, where the kernel trick is typically exploited in the input space as well. However, when inputs are images or texts, more expressive models such as deep neural networks seem more suited than non-parametric methods. In this work, we tackle the question of how to train neural networks to solve structured output prediction tasks, while still benefiting from the versatility and relevance of kernel-induced losses. We design a novel family of deep neural architectures, whose last layer predicts in a data-dependent finite-dimensional subspace of the infinite-dimensional output feature space deriving from the kernel-induced loss. This subspace is chosen as the span of the eigenfunctions of a randomly-approximated version of the empirical kernel covariance operator. Interestingly, this approach unlocks the use of gradient descent algorithms (and consequently of any neural architecture) for structured prediction. Experiments on synthetic tasks as well as real-world supervised graph prediction problems show the relevance of our method.">

        <tr id="Inverse problems have many applications in science and engineering. In Computer vision, several image restoration tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and super-resolution can be formally modeled as inverse problems. Recently, methods have been developed for solving inverse problems that only leverage a pre-trained unconditional diffusion model and do not require additional task-specific training. In such methods, however, the inherent intractability of determining the conditional score function during the reverse diffusion process poses a real challenge, leaving the methods to settle with an approximation instead, which affects their performance in practice. Here, we propose a MAP estimation framework to model the reverse conditional generation process of a continuous time diffusion model as an optimization process of the underlying MAP objective, whose gradient term is tractable. In theory, the proposed framework can be applied to solve general inverse problems using gradient-based optimization methods. However, given the highly non-convex nature of the loss objective, finding a perfect gradient-based optimization algorithm can be quite challenging, nevertheless, our framework offers several potential research directions. We use our proposed formulation and develop empirically effective algorithms for solving noiseless and noisy image inpainting tasks. We validate our proposed algorithms with extensive experiments across diverse mask settings.">

        <tr id="We present a unified approach to obtain scaling limits of neural networks using the genus expansion technique from random matrix theory. This approach begins with a novel expansion of neural networks which is reminiscent of Butcher series for ODEs, and is obtained through a generalisation of Fa\`a di Bruno's formula to an arbitrary number of compositions. In this expansion, the role of monomials is played by random multilinear maps indexed by directed graphs whose edges correspond to random matrices, which we call operator graphs. This expansion linearises the effect of the activation functions, allowing for the direct application of Wick's principle to compute the expectation of each of its terms. We then determine the leading contribution to each term by embedding the corresponding graphs onto surfaces, and computing their Euler characteristic. Furthermore, by developing a correspondence between analytic and graphical operations, we obtain similar graph expansions for the neural tangent kernel as well as the input-output Jacobian of the original neural network, and derive their infinite-width limits with relative ease. Notably, we find explicit formulae for the moments of the limiting singular value distribution of the Jacobian. We then show that all of these results hold for networks with more general weights, such as general matrices with i.i.d. entries satisfying moment assumptions, complex matrices and sparse matrices.">

        <tr id="In order to sample from an unnormalized probability density function, we propose to combine continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with rejection-resampling steps based on importance weights. We relate the iterative training of CNFs with regularized velocity fields to a JKO scheme and prove convergence of the involved velocity fields to the velocity field of the Wasserstein gradient flow (WGF). The alternation of local flow steps and non-local rejection-resampling steps allows to overcome local minima or slow convergence of the WGF for multimodal distributions. Since the proposal of the rejection step is generated by the model itself, they do not suffer from common drawbacks of classical rejection schemes. The arising model can be trained iteratively, reduces the reverse Kulback-Leibler (KL) loss function in each step, allows to generate iid samples and moreover allows for evaluations of the generated underlying density. Numerical examples show that our method yields accurate results on various test distributions including high-dimensional multimodal targets and outperforms the state of the art in almost all cases significantly.">

The success of deep learning has thus led many to use neural networks to learn to estimate SPD matrices in a data-driven fashion. For learning structured outputs, one promising strategy involves architectures designed by unrolling iterative algorithms, which potentially benefit from inductive bias properties. However, designing correct unrolled architectures for SPD learning is difficult: they either do not guarantee that their output has all the desired properties, rely on heavy computations, or are overly restrained to specific matrices which hinders their expressivity. In this paper, we propose a novel and generic learning module with guaranteed SPD outputs called SpodNet, that also enables learning a larger class of functions than existing approaches.

More precisely, the input space $\mathfrak X$ is allowed to be a general topological space satisfying only a mild condition ("quasi-Polish"), and the output space can be either another quasi-Polish space $\mathfrak Y$ or a topological vector space $E$.

The resulting neural network architecture is therefore applicable for prediction tasks based on functional data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result which deals with such a wide class of input/output spaces and simultaneously guarantees the numerical feasibility of the ensuing architectures. Finally, we prove an obstruction result which indicates that the category of quasi-Polish spaces is in a certain sense the correct category to work with if one aims at constructing approximating architectures on infinite-dimensional spaces $\mathfrak X$ which, at the same time, have sufficient expressive power to approximate continuous functions on $\mathfrak X$, are specified by a finite number of parameters only and are"stable"with respect to these parameters.">

        <tr id="Optimization of machine learning architectures is essential in determining the efficacy and the applicability of any neural architecture to real world problems. In this work a generalized Newton's method (GNM) is presented as a powerful approach to learning in deep neural networks (DNN). This technique was compared to two popular approaches, namely the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and the Adam algorithm, in two popular classification tasks. The performance of the proposed approach confirmed it as an attractive alternative to state-of-the-art first order solutions. Due to the good results presented in the case of shallow DNN, in the last part of the article an hybrid optimization method is presented. This method consists in combining two optimization algorithms, i.e. GNM and Adam or GNM and SGD, during the training phase within the layers of the neural network. This configuration aims to benefit from the strengths of both first- and second-order algorithms. In this case a convolutional neural network is considered and its parameters are updated with a different optimization algorithm. Also in this case, the hybrid approach returns the best performance with respect to the first order algorithms.">

The RRNN method commences by decomposing the computational domain into non-overlapping subdomains. Within each subdomain, the solution to the localized subproblem is approximated by a randomized radial basis function neural network with a Gaussian kernel. This network is distinguished by the random assignment of width and center coefficients for its activation functions, thereby rendering the training process focused solely on determining the weight coefficients of the output layer. For each subproblem, similar to the Petrov-Galerkin finite element method, a linear system will be formulated on the foundation of a weak formulation. Subsequently, a selection of collocation points is stochastically sampled at the boundaries of the subdomain, ensuring satisfying $C^0$ and $C^1$ continuity and boundary conditions to couple these localized solutions. The network is ultimately trained using the least squares method to ascertain the output layer weights. To validate the RRNN method's effectiveness, an extensive array of numerical experiments has been executed and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the accuracy and efficiency well.">

Second, we represent the value function using a neural network and train it to solve the differential equation using deep learning tools. We refer to the solution as an Economic Model Informed Neural Network (EMINN). The main advantage of this technique is that it allows us to find global solutions to high dimensional, non-linear problems.

This approach makes full use of the hidden information between the variable functions and independent variables. The process whereby the model captures incredibly complex and highly nonlinear relationships is simplified, thereby making network learning easier and enhancing the extraction of information about the independent variables in partial differential systems.

        <tr id="First-order methods, such as gradient descent (GD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) have been proven effective in training neural networks. In the setting of over-parameterization, there is a line of work demonstrating that randomly initialized (stochastic) gradient descent converges to a globally optimal solution at a linear convergence rate for the quadratic loss function. However, the learning rate of GD in training two-layer neural networks has a poor dependence on the sample size and the Gram matrix, resulting in a slow training process. In this paper, we show that for the $L^2$ regression problems, the learning rate can be improved from $\mathcal{O}(\lambda_0/n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1/\|\bm{H}^{\infty}\|_2)$, which implies that GD enjoys a faster convergence rate. Moreover, we further generalize the method for GD in training two-layer Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), showing a similar improvement for the learning rate. Although the improved learning rate depends mildly on the Gram matrix, we still need to set it small enough in practice due to the agnostic eigenvalues of the Gram matrix. More importantly, the convergence rate relies on the least eigenvalue of the Gram matrix, leading to slow convergence. In this work, we provide the convergence analysis of natural gradient descent (NGD) in training two-layer PINNs. We show that the learning rate can be $\mathcal{O}(1)$ and at this time, the convergence rate is independent of the Gram matrix.">

        <tr id="Computing the loss gradient via backpropagation consumes considerable energy during deep learning (DL) model training. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to efficiently compute DL models' gradients to mitigate the substantial energy overhead associated with backpropagation. Exploiting the over-parameterized nature of DL models and the smoothness of their loss landscapes, we propose a method called {\em GradSamp} for sampling gradient updates from a Gaussian distribution. Specifically, we update model parameters at a given epoch (chosen periodically or randomly) by perturbing the parameters (element-wise) from the previous epoch with Gaussian ``noise''. The parameters of the Gaussian distribution are estimated using the error between the model parameter values from the two previous epochs. {\em GradSamp} not only streamlines gradient computation but also enables skipping entire epochs, thereby enhancing overall efficiency. We rigorously validate our hypothesis across a diverse set of standard and non-standard CNN and transformer-based models, spanning various computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. Additionally, we explore its efficacy in out-of-distribution scenarios such as Domain Adaptation (DA), Domain Generalization (DG), and decentralized settings like Federated Learning (FL). Our experimental results affirm the effectiveness of {\em GradSamp} in achieving notable energy savings without compromising performance, underscoring its versatility and potential impact in practical DL applications.">

        <tr id="Given the existence of various forward and inverse problems in combustion studies and applications that necessitate distinct methods for resolution, a framework to solve them in a unified way is critically needed. A promising approach is the integration of machine learning methods with governing equations of combustion systems, which exhibits superior generality and few-shot learning ability compared to purely data-driven methods. In this work, the FlamePINN-1D framework is proposed to solve the forward and inverse problems of 1D laminar flames based on physics-informed neural networks. Three cases with increasing complexity have been tested: Case 1 are freely-propagating premixed (FPP) flames with simplified physical models, while Case 2 and Case 3 are FPP and counterflow premixed (CFP) flames with detailed models, respectively. For forward problems, FlamePINN-1D aims to solve the flame fields and infer the unknown eigenvalues (such as laminar flame speeds) under the constraints of governing equations and boundary conditions. For inverse problems, FlamePINN-1D aims to reconstruct the continuous fields and infer the unknown parameters (such as transport and chemical kinetics parameters) from noisy sparse observations of the flame. Our results strongly validate these capabilities of FlamePINN-1D across various flames and working conditions. Compared to traditional methods, FlamePINN-1D is differentiable and mesh-free, exhibits no discretization errors, and is easier to implement for inverse problems. The inverse problem results also indicate the possibility of optimizing chemical mechanisms from measurements of laboratory 1D flames. Furthermore, some proposed strategies, such as hard constraints and thin-layer normalization, are proven to be essential for the robust learning of FlamePINN-1D.

In this paper we propose a dynamical low-rank algorithm for the kinetic CME using binary tree tensor networks. The dimensionality of the problem is reduced in this approach by hierarchically dividing the reaction network into partitions.

        <tr id="Prolonged contact between a corrosive liquid and metal alloys can cause progressive dealloying. For such liquid-metal dealloying (LMD) process, phase field models have been developed. However, the governing equations often involve coupled non-linear partial differential equations (PDE), which are challenging to solve numerically. In particular, stiffness in the PDEs requires an extremely small time steps (e.g. $10^{-12}$ or smaller). This computational bottleneck is especially problematic when running LMD simulation until a late time horizon is required. This motivates the development of surrogate models capable of leaping forward in time, by skipping several consecutive time steps at-once. In this paper, we propose U-Shaped Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators (U-AFNO), a machine learning (ML) model inspired by recent advances in neural operator learning. U-AFNO employs U-Nets for extracting and reconstructing local features within the physical fields, and passes the latent space through a vision transformer (ViT) implemented in the Fourier space (AFNO). We use U-AFNOs to learn the dynamics mapping the field at a current time step into a later time step. We also identify global quantities of interest (QoI) describing the corrosion process (e.g. the deformation of the liquid-metal interface) and show that our proposed U-AFNO model is able to accurately predict the field dynamics, in-spite of the chaotic nature of LMD. Our model reproduces the key micro-structure statistics and QoIs with a level of accuracy on-par with the high-fidelity numerical solver. We also investigate the opportunity of using hybrid simulations, in which we alternate forward leap in time using the U-AFNO with high-fidelity time stepping. We demonstrate that while advantageous for some surrogate model design choices, our proposed U-AFNO model in fully auto-regressive settings consistently outperforms hybrid schemes.">

Although equivariant architectures have been studied extensively, much less is known about the training dynamics of equivariant neural networks. Concurrently, neural tangent kernels (NTKs) have emerged as a powerful tool to analytically understand the training dynamics of wide neural networks. In this work, we combine these two fields for the first time by giving explicit expressions for NTKs of group convolutional neural networks.

While experimental data on certain state variables may be available, integrating these data with numerical solvers remains a significant challenge. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promising results in various engineering disciplines, particularly in handling noisy data and solving inverse problems. However, their effectiveness in forecasting nonlinear phenomena in multiphysics regimes is yet to be fully established. This study introduces NeuroSEM, a hybrid framework integrating PINNs with the high-fidelity Spectral Element Method (SEM) solver, Nektar++. NeuroSEM leverages strengths of both PINNs and SEM, providing robust solutions for multiphysics problems. PINNs are trained to assimilate data and model physical phenomena in specific subdomains, which are then integrated into Nektar++. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of NeuroSEM for thermal convection in cavity flow and flow past a cylinder. The framework effectively handles data assimilation by addressing those subdomains and state variables where data are available. We applied NeuroSEM to the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection system, including cases with missing thermal boundary conditions. Our results indicate that NeuroSEM accurately models the physical phenomena and assimilates the data within the specified subdomains. The framework's plug-and-play nature facilitates its extension to other multiphysics or multiscale problems. Furthermore, NeuroSEM is optimized for an efficient execution on emerging integrated GPU-CPU architectures. This hybrid approach enhances the accuracy and efficiency of simulations, making it a powerful tool for tackling complex engineering challenges in various scientific domains.">

        <tr id="This paper expands the damped block Newton (dBN) method introduced recently in [4] for 1D diffusion-reaction equations and least-squares data fitting problems. To determine the linear parameters (the weights and bias of the output layer) of the neural network (NN), the dBN method requires solving systems of linear equations involving the mass matrix. While the mass matrix for local hat basis functions is tri-diagonal and well-conditioned, the mass matrix for NNs is dense and ill-conditioned. For example, the condition number of the NN mass matrix for quasi-uniform meshes is at least ${\cal O}(n^4)$. We present a factorization of the mass matrix that enables solving the systems of linear equations in ${\cal O}(n)$ operations. To determine the non-linear parameters (the weights and bias of the hidden layer), one step of a damped Newton method is employed at each iteration. A Gauss-Newton method is used in place of Newton for the instances in which the Hessian matrices are singular. This modified dBN is referred to as dBGN. For both methods, the computational cost per iteration is ${\cal O}(n)$. Numerical results demonstrate the ability dBN and dBGN to efficiently achieve accurate results and outperform BFGS for select examples.">

        <tr id="Optimal transport (OT) has profoundly impacted machine learning by providing theoretical and computational tools to realign datasets. In this context, given two large point clouds of sizes $n$ and $m$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, entropic OT (EOT) solvers have emerged as the most reliable tool to either solve the Kantorovich problem and output a $n\times m$ coupling matrix, or to solve the Monge problem and learn a vector-valued push-forward map. While the robustness of EOT couplings/maps makes them a go-to choice in practical applications, EOT solvers remain difficult to tune because of a small but influential set of hyperparameters, notably the omnipresent entropic regularization strength $\varepsilon$. Setting $\varepsilon$ can be difficult, as it simultaneously impacts various performance metrics, such as compute speed, statistical performance, generalization, and bias. In this work, we propose a new class of EOT solvers (ProgOT), that can estimate both plans and transport maps. We take advantage of several opportunities to optimize the computation of EOT solutions by dividing mass displacement using a time discretization, borrowing inspiration from dynamic OT formulations, and conquering each of these steps using EOT with properly scheduled parameters. We provide experimental evidence demonstrating that ProgOT is a faster and more robust alternative to standard solvers when computing couplings at large scales, even outperforming neural network-based approaches. We also prove statistical consistency of our approach for estimating optimal transport maps.">

Application of ML methods to data-scarce scientific problems can be made more effective via several routes, one of them is equivariant neural networks possessing knowledge of symmetries. Here we suggest that combination of symmetry-aware invariant architectures and stacks of dilated convolutions is a very effective and easy to implement receipt allowing sizable improvements in accuracy over standard approaches. We apply it to representative physical problems from different realms: prediction of bandgaps of photonic crystals, and network approximations of magnetic ground states.

In reinforcement learning, the performance of continuously differentiable activations often falls short as compared to linear-unit functions. From the perspective of the activations in the last hidden layer, this paper provides insights regarding this sub-optimality and explores how activation functions influence the occurrence of dead neurons and the magnitude of the effective rank. Additionally, a novel neural architecture is proposed that leverages the product of independent activation values.

It then demonstrates that a prediction problem modeled through an RNN, with a specific regularization term in the loss function, can have its first-order conditions expressed analytically. This system of equations is reduced to two matrix equations involving Sylvester equations, which can be partially solved. We establish that, if certain conditions are met, optimal parameters exist, are unique, and can be found through a straightforward algorithm to any desired precision. Also, as the number of neurons grows the conditions of convergence become easier to fulfill. Feedforward neural networks (FNNs) are also explored by including linear constraints on parameters.

 In this paper, we introduce the deep numerical technique DeepNM, which is designed for solving one-dimensional (1D) hyperbolic conservation laws, particularly wave equations. By creatively integrating traditional numerical schemes with deep learning techniques, the method yields improvements over conventional approaches. Specifically, we compare this approach against two established classical numerical methods: the Discontinuous Galerkin method (DG) and the Lax-Wendroff correction method (LWC). While maintaining a comparable level of accuracy, DeepNM significantly improves computational speed, surpassing conventional numerical methods in this aspect by more than tenfold, and reducing storage requirements by over 1000 times. Furthermore, DeepNM facilitates the utilization of higher-order numerical schemes and allows for an increased number of grid points, thereby enhancing precision. In contrast to the more prevalent PINN method, DeepNM optimally combines the strengths of conventional mathematical techniques with deep learning, resulting in heightened accuracy and expedited computations for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Notably, DeepNM introduces a novel research paradigm for numerical equation-solving that can be seamlessly integrated with various traditional numerical methods.">

However, this approach introduces an urgent problem: current deep learning models are predominantly serial, meaning that as the number of network layers increases, so do the training and inference times. This is unacceptable if deep learning is to continue advancing. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning parallelization strategy based on the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT). From this foundation, we designed a parallel network called Para-Former to test our theory. Unlike traditional serial models, the inference time of Para-Former does not increase with the number of layers, significantly accelerating the inference speed of multi-layer networks.

        <tr id="Diffusion models have made significant progress in current image generation tasks, thus becoming a prominent area of research. Diffusion models necessitate repetitive iterations on minimally altered input data across timesteps, each timestep requiring the recalculation of the entire model, resulting in a remarkable computational redundancy and substantial hardware expenditures.Performing differential computing on input data seems to be a feasible approach for addressing such computational redundancy and improving hardware efficacy. However, non-linear operations (particularly activation functions) necessitate the merging of deltas (i.e., differential values) with raw inputs repeatedly to ensure computational correctness, leading to significant memory access for loading raw inputs, which fragmentedly blocks the forwarding of deltas throughout the network and undermines performance.To solve this problem, we propose Cambricon-D, a fullnetwork differential computing architecture with concise memory access. While maintaining the computational efficiency brought by differential computing, Cambricon-D employs a sign-mask dataflow, which requires only the loading of 1-bit signs (instead of large bitwidth raw inputs), thereby facilitating the seamless forwarding of deltas and effectively mitigating memory access overheads. Experimental results show that, compared to Diffy, Cambricon-D’s dataflow reduces 66% ~ 82% off-chip memory access. In total, Cambricon-D achieves 1.46× ~ 2.38× speedup over A100 on various diffusion models with different resolutions.">

        <tr id="Diffusion models have recently been shown to excel in many image reconstruction tasks that involve inverse problems based on a forward measurement operator. A common framework uses task-agnostic unconditional models that are later post-conditioned for reconstruction, an approach that typically suffers from suboptimal task performance. While task-specific conditional models have also been proposed, current methods heuristically inject measured data as a naive input channel that elicits sampling inaccuracies. Here, we address the optimal conditioning of diffusion models for solving challenging inverse problems that arise during image reconstruction. Specifically, we propose a novel Bayesian conditioning technique for diffusion models, BCDM, based on score-functions associated with the conditional distribution of desired images given measured data. We rigorously derive the theory to express and train the conditional score-function. Finally, we show state-of-the-art performance in image dealiasing, deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting with the proposed technique.">

        <tr id="The ubiquity of deep learning algorithms in various applications has amplified the need for assuring their robustness against small input perturbations such as those occurring in adversarial attacks. Existing complete verification techniques offer provable guarantees for all robustness queries but struggle to scale beyond small neural networks. To overcome this computational intractability, incomplete verification methods often rely on convex relaxation to over-approximate the nonlinearities in neural networks. Progress in tighter approximations has been achieved for piecewise linear functions. However, robustness verification of neural networks for general activation functions (e.g., Sigmoid, Tanh) remains under-explored and poses new challenges. Typically, these networks are verified using convex relaxation techniques, which involve computing linear upper and lower bounds of the nonlinear activation functions. In this work, we propose a novel parameter search method to improve the quality of these linear approximations. Specifically, we show that using a simple search method, carefully adapted to the given verification problem through state-of-the-art algorithm configuration techniques, improves the average global lower bound by 25% on average over the current state of the art on several commonly used local robustness verification benchmarks.">

Continual learning algorithms seek to mitigate this effect by sustaining good predictive performance while maintaining network trainability. We develop new techniques for improving continual learning by first reconsidering how initialization can ensure trainability during early phases of learning. From this perspective, we derive new regularization strategies for continual learning that ensure beneficial initialization properties are better maintained throughout training. In particular, we investigate two new regularization techniques for continual learning: (i) Wasserstein regularization toward the initial weight distribution, which is less restrictive than regularizing toward initial weights; and (ii) regularizing weight matrix singular values, which directly ensures gradient diversity is maintained throughout training. We present an experimental analysis that shows these alternative regularizers can improve continual learning performance across a range of supervised learning tasks and model architectures. The alternative regularizers prove to be less sensitive to hyperparameters while demonstrating better training in individual tasks, sustaining trainability as new tasks arrive, and achieving better generalization performance.">

Despite significant advancements made by recent neural solvers, their limited expressiveness does not conform well to the multi-modal nature of CO landscapes. While some research has pivoted towards diffusion models, they require simulating a Markov chain with many steps to produce a sample, which is time-consuming and does not meet the efficiency requirement of real applications, especially at scale. We propose DISCO, an efficient DIffusion Solver for Combinatorial Optimization problems that excels in both solution quality and inference speed. DISCO's efficacy is two-pronged: Firstly, it achieves rapid denoising of solutions through an analytically solvable form, allowing for direct sampling from the solution space with very few reverse-time steps, thereby drastically reducing inference time. Secondly, DISCO enhances solution quality by restricting the sampling space to a more constrained, meaningful domain guided by solution residues, while still preserving the inherent multi-modality of the output probabilistic distributions. DISCO achieves state-of-the-art results on very large Traveling Salesman Problems with 10000 nodes and challenging Maximal Independent Set benchmarks, with its per-instance denoising time up to 44.8 times faster. Through further combining a divide-and-conquer strategy, DISCO can be generalized to solve arbitrary-scale problem instances off the shelf, even outperforming models trained specifically on corresponding scales.">

Geological models of reservoirs are often associated with high uncertainly leading to many numerical simulations for history matching and production optimization. Machine learning models trained with simulation data can provide a faster alternative to traditional simulators. In this paper we present a single Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) surrogate that outperforms traditional reservoir simulators by the ability to predict pressures and saturations on varying permeability fields, well locations, well controls, and number of wells. The maximum-mean relative error of 95\% of pressure and saturation predictions is less than 5\%. This is achieved by employing a simple yet very effective data augmentation technique that reduces the dataset size by 75\% and reduces overfitting. Also, constructing the input tensor in a binary fashion enables predictions on unseen well locations, well controls, and number of wells. Such model can accelerate history matching and reservoir characterization procedures by several orders of magnitude. The ability to predict on new well locations, well controls, and number of wells enables highly efficient reservoir management and optimization.">

        <tr id="Studies show that artificial intelligence (AI) with embedded physics solvers has improved the accuracy of predictions on various physics problems, especially those associated with fluid dynamics. The crucial element in optimizing weight training for estimating flow fields within the AI network lies in the choice of the loss function. In addressing regression-type problems, particularly those involving the temporal evolution of flow fields, the mean square error (MSE) loss function is commonly employed at the current and single time step. However, an issue arises in existing methodologies that utilize MSE-based loss functions with single-time step information for predicting unsteady flow. Most of these approaches overlook the significance of incorporating the temporal history of the flow, a factor that cannot be disregarded in the context of numerical solvers. Hence, in this work, a physics-based AI (PbAI) method with higher-order loss functions is applied to unsteady scenarios, in particular to two distinct turbulent flows where a multitude of fine structures is present, namely, forced and decaying turbulence. Direct numerical simulations on uniform Cartesian grids are conducted to simulate these scenarios, generating two distinct datasets for training and inference. Each dataset comprises 32 randomly initialized conditions spanning 4, 848 time steps for each turbulent flow type. Five distinct models are devised, incorporating features such as rollouts from coarse numerical solvers and temporal considerations in the loss function calculation. The constructed PbAI models demonstrate consistent improvements in predictive performance over the entire temporal domain. These findings are further corroborated through vorticity correlation analyses. The empirical result demonstrates that the accuracy of the baseline case improves by up to 48% and 30% for forced and decaying turbulence, respectively. These results significantly underscore the importance of the temporal histories of flow in the loss function in enhancing predictive capabilities for complex and unsteady turbulent flows.">

        <tr id="Discrete diffusion modeling is a promising framework for modeling and generating data in discrete spaces. To sample from these models, different strategies present trade-offs between computation and sample quality. A predominant sampling strategy is predictor-corrector $\tau$-leaping, which simulates the continuous time generative process with discretized predictor steps and counteracts the accumulation of discretization error via corrector steps. However, for absorbing state diffusion, an important class of discrete diffusion models, the standard forward-backward corrector can be ineffective in fixing such errors, resulting in subpar sample quality. To remedy this problem, we propose a family of informed correctors that more reliably counteracts discretization error by leveraging information learned by the model. For further efficiency gains, we also propose $k$-Gillespie's, a sampling algorithm that better utilizes each model evaluation, while still enjoying the speed and flexibility of $\tau$-leaping. Across several real and synthetic datasets, we show that $k$-Gillespie's with informed correctors reliably produces higher quality samples at lower computational cost.">

        <tr id="Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been successfully applied to a wide range of problems. However, two main limitations are commonly pointed out. The first one is that they require long time to design. The other is that they heavily rely on labelled data, which can sometimes be costly and hard to obtain. In order to address the first problem, neuroevolution has been proved to be a plausible option to automate the design of DNNs. As for the second problem, self-supervised learning has been used to leverage unlabelled data to learn representations. Our goal is to study how neuroevolution can help self-supervised learning to bridge the gap to supervised learning in terms of performance. In this work, we propose a framework that is able to evolve deep neural networks using self-supervised learning. Our results on the CIFAR-10 dataset show that it is possible to evolve adequate neural networks while reducing the reliance on labelled data. Moreover, an analysis to the structure of the evolved networks suggests that the amount of labelled data fed to them has less effect on the structure of networks that learned via self-supervised learning, when compared to individuals that relied on supervised learning.">

        <tr id="Geological parameterization entails the representation of a geomodel using a small set of latent variables and a mapping from these variables to grid-block properties such as porosity and permeability. Parameterization is useful for data assimilation (history matching), as it maintains geological realism while reducing the number of variables to be determined. Diffusion models are a new class of generative deep-learning procedures that have been shown to outperform previous methods, such as generative adversarial networks, for image generation tasks. Diffusion models are trained to"denoise", which enables them to generate new geological realizations from input fields characterized by random noise. Latent diffusion models, which are the specific variant considered in this study, provide dimension reduction through use of a low-dimensional latent variable. The model developed in this work includes a variational autoencoder for dimension reduction and a U-net for the denoising process. Our application involves conditional 2D three-facies (channel-levee-mud) systems. The latent diffusion model is shown to provide realizations that are visually consistent with samples from geomodeling software. Quantitative metrics involving spatial and flow-response statistics are evaluated, and general agreement between the diffusion-generated models and reference realizations is observed. Stability tests are performed to assess the smoothness of the parameterization method. The latent diffusion model is then used for ensemble-based data assimilation. Two synthetic"true"models are considered. Significant uncertainty reduction, posterior P$_{10}$-P$_{90}$ forecasts that generally bracket observed data, and consistent posterior geomodels, are achieved in both cases.">

        <tr id="Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in learning from graph-structured data. However, their application to directed graphs (digraphs) presents unique challenges, primarily due to the inherent asymmetry in node relationships. Traditional GNNs are adept at capturing unidirectional relations but fall short in encoding the mutual path dependencies between nodes, such as asymmetrical shortest paths typically found in digraphs. Recognizing this gap, we introduce Commute Graph Neural Networks (CGNN), an approach that seamlessly integrates node-wise commute time into the message passing scheme. The cornerstone of CGNN is an efficient method for computing commute time using a newly formulated digraph Laplacian. Commute time information is then integrated into the neighborhood aggregation process, with neighbor contributions weighted according to their respective commute time to the central node in each layer. It enables CGNN to directly capture the mutual, asymmetric relationships in digraphs.">

        <tr id="Different from human nature, it is still common practice today for vision tasks to train deep learning models only initially and on fixed datasets. A variety of approaches have recently addressed handling continual data streams. However, extending these methods to manage out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios has not effectively been investigated. On the other hand, it has recently been shown that non-continual neural mesh models exhibit strong performance in generalizing to such OOD scenarios. To leverage this decisive property in a continual learning setting, we propose incremental neural mesh models that can be extended with new meshes over time. In addition, we present a latent space initialization strategy that enables us to allocate feature space for future unseen classes in advance and a positional regularization term that forces the features of the different classes to consistently stay in respective latent space regions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on the Pascal3D and ObjectNet3D datasets and show that our approach outperforms the baselines for classification by $2-6\%$ in the in-domain and by $6-50\%$ in the OOD setting. Our work also presents the first incremental learning approach for pose estimation. Our code and model can be found at https://github.com/Fischer-Tom/iNeMo.">

Our training procedure is conservative by design, has low stochasticity, is solvable with open-source solvers, and is scalable to large industrial deployments. We provide out-of-sample performance guarantees and show that hard convex physical constraints can be enforced in the training program. WaDiRo-SCNN aims to make neural networks safer for critical applications, such as in the energy sector. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the performance of our model on a synthetic experiment and a real-world power system application, i.e., the prediction of non-residential buildings' hourly energy consumption.

        <tr id="We previously presented a novel loss formulation for efficient learning of complex dynamics from governing physics, typically described by partial differential equations (PDEs), using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). In these experiments, the incorporation of a Boundary Connectivity (BCXN) loss function was shown to greatly improve physics-informed learning across many problems, especially those with complex geometries. However, this imposition may not always be ideal, as the previously presented BCXN-loss strongly enforces a linear local structure at the boundary. While this assumption helps facilitate faster learning with an order of magnitude sparser training samples, this can adversely impact convergence in other situations. Hence, we propose a modification of this BCXN-loss that reduces the imposed structure to a soft constraint, allowing for more flexible learning and convergence. We further demonstrate the potential for this method to improve the convergence and performance of LSA-PINN across additional numerical experiments, with much smaller errors than existing methods in terms of the standard L2-norm metric. In particular, we have applied this method to the modelling of flow past complex geometries such as airfoils, which serve as the basic building block for various applications in fluid dynamics and renewable energy (e.g., in wind and tidal turbine design).">

        <tr id="Neural networks that can produce accurate, input-conditional uncertainty representations are critical for real-world applications. Recent progress on heteroscedastic continuous regression has shown great promise for calibrated uncertainty quantification on complex tasks, like image regression. However, when these methods are applied to discrete regression tasks, such as crowd counting, ratings prediction, or inventory estimation, they tend to produce predictive distributions with numerous pathologies. We propose to address these issues by training a neural network to output the parameters of a Double Poisson distribution, which we call the Deep Double Poisson Network (DDPN). In contrast to existing methods that are trained to minimize Gaussian negative log likelihood (NLL), DDPNs produce a proper probability mass function over discrete output. Additionally, DDPNs naturally model under-, over-, and equi-dispersion, unlike networks trained with the more rigid Poisson and Negative Binomial parameterizations. We show DDPNs 1) vastly outperform existing discrete models; 2) meet or exceed the accuracy and flexibility of networks trained with Gaussian NLL; 3) produce proper predictive distributions over discrete counts; and 4) exhibit superior out-of-distribution detection. DDPNs can easily be applied to a variety of count regression datasets including tabular, image, point cloud, and text data.">

        <tr id="Predicting the dynamics of turbulent fluid flows has long been a central goal of science and engineering. Yet, even with modern computing technology, accurate simulation of all but the simplest turbulent flow-fields remains impossible: the fields are too chaotic and multi-scaled to directly store them in memory and perform time-evolution. An alternative is to treat turbulence $\textit{probabilistically}$, viewing flow properties as random variables distributed according to joint probability density functions (PDFs). Turbulence PDFs are neither chaotic nor multi-scale, but are still challenging to simulate due to their high dimensionality. Here we show how to overcome the dimensionality problem by parameterising turbulence PDFs into an extremely compressed format known as a"tensor network"(TN). The TN paradigm enables simulations on single CPU cores that would otherwise be impractical even with supercomputers: for a $5+1$ dimensional PDF of a chemically reactive turbulent flow, we achieve reductions in memory and computational costs by factors of $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$, respectively, compared to standard finite difference algorithms. A future path is opened towards something heretofore regarded as infeasible: directly simulating high-dimensional PDFs of both turbulent flows and other chaotic systems that are useful to describe probabilistically.">

In response, this study presents a novel methodology aimed at enhancing the predictive capability of PINNs for time-dependent scenarios.

This process demands sample-efficient optimization due to the high computational cost of function evaluations. While prior studies focus on forward approaches to learn surrogates for the unknown objective function, they struggle with high-dimensional inputs where valid inputs form a small subspace (e.g., valid protein sequences), which is common in real-world tasks. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capability in learning the high-dimensional data manifold. They have shown promising performance in black-box optimization tasks but only in offline settings. In this work, we propose diffusion-based inverse modeling for black-box optimization (Diff-BBO), the first inverse approach leveraging diffusion models for online BBO problem. Diff-BBO distinguishes itself from forward approaches through the design of acquisition function. Instead of proposing candidates in the design space, Diff-BBO employs a novel acquisition function Uncertainty-aware Exploration (UaE) to propose objective function values, which leverages the uncertainty of a conditional diffusion model to generate samples in the design space. Theoretically, we prove that using UaE leads to optimal optimization outcomes. Empirically, we redesign experiments on the Design-Bench benchmark for online settings and show that Diff-BBO achieves state-of-the-art performance.">

        <tr id="Deep learning has exhibited remarkable results across diverse areas. To understand its success, substantial research has been directed towards its theoretical foundations. Nevertheless, the majority of these studies examine how well deep neural networks can model functions with uniform regularity. In this paper, we explore a different angle: how deep neural networks can adapt to different regularity in functions across different locations and scales and nonuniform data distributions. More precisely, we focus on a broad class of functions defined by nonlinear tree-based approximation. This class encompasses a range of function types, such as functions with uniform regularity and discontinuous functions. We develop nonparametric approximation and estimation theories for this function class using deep ReLU networks. Our results show that deep neural networks are adaptive to different regularity of functions and nonuniform data distributions at different locations and scales. We apply our results to several function classes, and derive the corresponding approximation and generalization errors. The validity of our results is demonstrated through numerical experiments.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed deep learning has emerged as a promising alternative for solving partial differential equations. However, for complex problems, training these networks can still be challenging, often resulting in unsatisfactory accuracy and efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate that the failure of plain physics-informed neural networks arises from the significant discrepancy in the convergence speed of residuals at different training points, where the slowest convergence speed dominates the overall solution convergence. Based on these observations, we propose a point-wise adaptive weighting method that balances the residual decay rate across different training points. The performance of our proposed adaptive weighting method is compared with current state-of-the-art adaptive weighting methods on benchmark problems for both physics-informed neural networks and physics-informed deep operator networks. Through extensive numerical results we demonstrate that our proposed approach of balanced residual decay rates offers several advantages, including bounded weights, high prediction accuracy, fast convergence speed, low training uncertainty, low computational cost and ease of hyperparameter tuning.">

This collective effect of non-linearity, noise, learning rate, width, depth, and numerous other parameters, has eluded first-principles theories which are built from microscopic neuronal dynamics. Here we present a noise-non-linearity phase diagram that highlights where shallow or deep layers learn features more effectively. We then propose a macroscopic mechanical theory of feature learning that accurately reproduces this phase diagram, offering a clear intuition for why and how some DNNs are ``lazy'' and some are ``active'', and relating the distribution of feature learning over layers with test accuracy.">

        <tr id="Generalization theory has been established for sparse deep neural networks under high-dimensional regime. Beyond generalization, parameter estimation is also important since it is crucial for variable selection and interpretability of deep neural networks. Current theoretical studies concerning parameter estimation mainly focus on two-layer neural networks, which is due to the fact that the convergence of parameter estimation heavily relies on the regularity of the Hessian matrix, while the Hessian matrix of deep neural networks is highly singular. To avoid the unidentifiability of deep neural networks in parameter estimation, we propose to conduct nonparametric estimation of partial derivatives with respect to inputs. We first show that model convergence of sparse deep neural networks is guaranteed in that the sample complexity only grows with the logarithm of the number of parameters or the input dimension when the $\ell_{1}$-norm of parameters is well constrained. Then by bounding the norm and the divergence of partial derivatives, we establish that the convergence rate of nonparametric estimation of partial derivatives scales as $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/4})$, a rate which is slower than the model convergence rate $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$. To the best of our knowledge, this study combines nonparametric estimation and parametric sparse deep neural networks for the first time. As nonparametric estimation of partial derivatives is of great significance for nonlinear variable selection, the current results show the promising future for the interpretability of deep neural networks.">

Our research framework enables us to explore the intricate interplay between kernel methods and optimization processes, shedding light on the optimization dynamics and convergence properties of neural networks. In this study, we establish sharp convergence rates for the last iterate of the SGD algorithm in overparameterized two-layer neural networks. Additionally, we have made significant advancements in relaxing the constraints on the number of neurons, which have been reduced from exponential dependence to polynomial dependence on the sample size or number of iterations. This improvement allows for more flexibility in the design and scaling of neural networks, and will deepen our theoretical understanding of neural network models trained with SGD.">

        <tr id="Hysteresis modeling is crucial to comprehend the behavior of magnetic devices, facilitating optimal designs. Hitherto, deep learning-based methods employed to model hysteresis, face challenges in generalizing to novel input magnetic fields. This paper addresses the generalization challenge by proposing neural operators for modeling constitutive laws that exhibit magnetic hysteresis by learning a mapping between magnetic fields. In particular, two prominent neural operators -- deep operator network and Fourier neural operator -- are employed to predict novel first-order reversal curves and minor loops, where novel means they are not used to train the model. In addition, a rate-independent Fourier neural operator is proposed to predict material responses at sampling rates different from those used during training to incorporate the rate-independent characteristics of magnetic hysteresis. The presented numerical experiments demonstrate that neural operators efficiently model magnetic hysteresis, outperforming the traditional neural recurrent methods on various metrics and generalizing to novel magnetic fields. The findings emphasize the advantages of using neural operators for modeling hysteresis under varying magnetic conditions, underscoring their importance in characterizing magnetic material based devices.">

        <tr id="A central aim in computational neuroscience is to relate the activity of large populations of neurons to an underlying dynamical system. Models of these neural dynamics should ideally be both interpretable and fit the observed data well. Low-rank recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit such interpretability by having tractable dynamics. However, it is unclear how to best fit low-rank RNNs to data consisting of noisy observations of an underlying stochastic system. Here, we propose to fit stochastic low-rank RNNs with variational sequential Monte Carlo methods. We validate our method on several datasets consisting of both continuous and spiking neural data, where we obtain lower dimensional latent dynamics than current state of the art methods. Additionally, for low-rank models with piecewise linear nonlinearities, we show how to efficiently identify all fixed points in polynomial rather than exponential cost in the number of units, making analysis of the inferred dynamics tractable for large RNNs. Our method both elucidates the dynamical systems underlying experimental recordings and provides a generative model whose trajectories match observed trial-to-trial variability.">

        <tr id="In the past decade, significant strides in deep learning have led to numerous groundbreaking applications. Despite these advancements, the understanding of the high generalizability of deep learning, especially in such an over-parametrized space, remains limited. Successful applications are often considered as empirical rather than scientific achievements. For instance, deep neural networks' (DNNs) internal representations, decision-making mechanism, absence of overfitting in an over-parametrized space, high generalizability, etc., remain less understood. This paper delves into the loss landscape of DNNs through the lens of spin glass in statistical physics, i.e. a system characterized by a complex energy landscape with numerous metastable states, to better understand how DNNs work. We investigated a single hidden layer Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) neural network model, and introduced several protocols to examine the analogy between DNNs (trained with datasets including MNIST and CIFAR10) and spin glass. Specifically, we used (1) random walk in the parameter space of DNNs to unravel the structures in their loss landscape; (2) a permutation-interpolation protocol to study the connection between copies of identical regions in the loss landscape due to the permutation symmetry in the hidden layers; (3) hierarchical clustering to reveal the hierarchy among trained solutions of DNNs, reminiscent of the so-called Replica Symmetry Breaking (RSB) phenomenon (i.e. the Parisi solution) in analogy to spin glass; (4) finally, we examine the relationship between the degree of the ruggedness of the loss landscape of the DNN and its generalizability, showing an improvement of flattened minima.">

        <tr id="Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have attracted considerable attention for their event-driven, low-power characteristics and high biological interpretability. Inspired by knowledge distillation (KD), recent research has improved the performance of the SNN model with a pre-trained teacher model. However, additional teacher models require significant computational resources, and it is tedious to manually define the appropriate teacher network architecture. In this paper, we explore cost-effective self-distillation learning of SNNs to circumvent these concerns. Without an explicit defined teacher, the SNN generates pseudo-labels and learns consistency during training. On the one hand, we extend the timestep of the SNN during training to create an implicit temporal ``teacher"that guides the learning of the original ``student", i.e., the temporal self-distillation. On the other hand, we guide the output of the weak classifier at the intermediate stage by the final output of the SNN, i.e., the spatial self-distillation. Our temporal-spatial self-distillation (TSSD) learning method does not introduce any inference overhead and has excellent generalization ability. Extensive experiments on the static image datasets CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet as well as the neuromorphic datasets CIFAR10-DVS and DVS-Gesture validate the superior performance of the TSSD method. This paper presents a novel manner of fusing SNNs with KD, providing insights into high-performance SNN learning methods.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural network (PINN) is a neural network that combines machine learning methods with the physics of the problem often expressed in terms of differential equations along with boundary/initial conditions. In this paper, we employed unsupervised PINNs to solve steady-state incompressible laminar periodic flow problems without using any data. First, the PINN code for periodic flows was verified using flow between parallel plates. Further, two geometries were considered in this paper: periodic flow over cylinders between parallel plates and periodic flows through wavy channels, up to a maximum Reynolds number of 400. The proposed approach showed excellent results when compared to grid-independent computational fluid dynamics results with maximum L2-norm error of O(10−2) and O(10−1) for streamwise and cross-stream velocity, respectively.">

        <tr id="Introduction The deep echo state network (Deep-ESN) architecture, which comprises a multi-layered reservoir layer, exhibits superior performance compared to conventional echo state networks (ESNs) owing to the divergent layer-specific time-scale responses in the Deep-ESN. Although researchers have attempted to use experimental trial-and-error grid searches and Bayesian optimization methods to adjust the hyperparameters, suitable guidelines for setting hyperparameters to adjust the time scale of the dynamics in each layer from the perspective of dynamical characteristics have not been established. In this context, we hypothesized that evaluating the dependence of the multi-time-scale dynamical response on the leaking rate as a typical hyperparameter of the time scale in each neuron would help to achieve a guideline for optimizing the hyperparameters of the Deep-ESN. Method First, we set several leaking rates for each layer of the Deep-ESN and performed multi-scale entropy (MSCE) analysis to analyze the impact of the leaking rate on the dynamics in each layer. Second, we performed layer-by-layer cross-correlation analysis between adjacent layers to elucidate the structural mechanisms to enhance the performance. Results As a result, an optimum task-specific leaking rate value for producing layer-specific multi-time-scale responses and a queue structure with layer-to-layer signal transmission delays for retaining past applied input enhance the Deep-ESN prediction performance. Discussion These findings can help to establish ideal design guidelines for setting the hyperparameters of Deep-ESNs.">

        <tr id="The field of image synthesis is currently flourishing due to the advancements in diffusion models. While diffusion models have been successful, their computational intensity has prompted the pursuit of more efficient alternatives. As a representative work, non-autoregressive Transformers (NATs) have been recognized for their rapid generation. However, a major drawback of these models is their inferior performance compared to diffusion models. In this paper, we aim to re-evaluate the full potential of NATs by revisiting the design of their training and inference strategies. Specifically, we identify the complexities in properly configuring these strategies and indicate the possible sub-optimality in existing heuristic-driven designs. Recognizing this, we propose to go beyond existing methods by directly solving the optimal strategies in an automatic framework. The resulting method, named AutoNAT, advances the performance boundaries of NATs notably, and is able to perform comparably with the latest diffusion models at a significantly reduced inference cost. The effectiveness of AutoNAT is validated on four benchmark datasets, i.e., ImageNet-256&512, MS-COCO, and CC3M. Our code is available at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/ImprovedNAT.">
